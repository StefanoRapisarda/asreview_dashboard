Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods may help in optimizing medication alerts. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review on the current state of the use of AI to optimize medication alerts in a hospital setting. Specifically, we aimed to identify the applied AI methods used together with their performance measures and main outcome measures.                                            Materials and Methods                We searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library database on May 25, 2023 for studies of any quantitative design, in which the use of AI-based methods was investigated to optimize medication alerts generated by CDSSs in a hospital setting.

Three studies (30%) reported on both statistical performance and clinical outcomes. The most often reported performance measure was positive predictive value ranging from 9% to 100%. Regarding main outcome measures, alerts optimized using AI-based methods resulted in a decreased alert burden, increased identification of inappropriate or atypical prescriptions, and enabled prediction of user responses. In only 2 studies the AI-based alerts were implemented in hospital practice, and none of the studies conducted external validation.

It is nearly impossible for clinicians and researchers to stay current with the evidence, and traditional systematic reviews and clinical guidelines are not suited to ensure a continued overview of all trials and their results. To address this problem, we have designed a free-to-use, and publicly available database of clinical trials that aims to be continuously updated, the Cancer Immunotherapy Evidence Living (CIEL) Library.                                      Methods                              We aimed to include planned, ongoing, and completed interventional trials of immunotherapies for cancer, regardless of trial design (e.g., randomization, blinding, and type of comparator). We systematically searched PubMed (for published reports) and                ClinicalTrials.gov                (for registered clinical trials). PubMed retrieved records were screened using the AI-assisted software ASReview and manually extracted and curated. We imported data from                ClinicalTrials.gov                using the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative database which then requires further curation. The CIEL-Library is available and searchable via a web application (                https://app.ciel-library.org/#/                ). It also contains the ‘Match My Patient’ feature, a patient-centered clinical decision support system, which can filter planned, ongoing or completed trials based on four patient characteristics (disease staging, previous treatments, performance status, and location). We piloted our database with one type of cancer immunotherapy, the tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) transfer.                                                    Conclusion              The CIEL-Library offers a blueprint for a dynamic evidence synthesis infrastructure providing an exhaustive collection of clinical trials with trial characteristics and results, which can be applied across different fields, specialties, and topics. The Match My Patient search function may be very useful to implement trial research into patient-centered care by helping to find a trial for enrolment of a patient or to find results for making decisions, for example, in tumor boards.              The main challenges to making a continuously updated database of clinical trials are the time and resources needed to populate it with curated and updated data. The CIEL-Library project illustrates the potential and the main limitations to designing such continuously updated trial databases that intent to be directly used in routine care.","2024-04-27","2024-09-05 12:05:21","2025-03-26 09:29:52","2024-09-05 12:05:21","","","","","","","Rationale and design of the Cancer Immunotherapy Evidence Living (CIEL) Library","","","","","","","en","","","","","Oncology","","","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Introduction Bariatric surgery-induced weight loss is partially attributed to shifts in food preferences resulting from alterations in sensory perceptions and changes in reward system. The stomach’s innervation and mechanical function have been theorized to play a significant role in these modifications, as suggested by numerous preclinical studies. However, the extent and nature of these connections in clinical settings require further elucidation. Inclusion criteria This review will examine studies on the influence of gastric innervation and/or mechanical function on food reward, olfaction, and taste. Selected studies will include participants of all ages with obesity or bariatric surgery. Both observational studies and controlled experiments will be considered, while study protocols, opinion articles, letters to the editor, book chapters, oral communication or poster abstracts and systematic reviews will be excluded. Methods The search will be undertaken in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and gray literature. No date parameters will be set, and all languages will be considered. Citations will be uploaded into EndNote 20.0 and duplicates removed using Covidence. The remaining studies will be analyzed by 3 reviewers using a two-stage procedure with the ASReview python package. The full-text screening and the data extraction will be conducted by 2 reviewers on Covidence. An additional reviewer will be consulted in the event of disagreement.

However, the same indications for deferred treatment of ventral hernias are generally applied to IH, regardless of the potentially different outcomes. This meta-analysis aims to compare the characteristics and outcomes of patients treated urgently for IH with those undergoing elective surgery.                                            Method                Medline and Scopus were systematically searched from 1990–2023. Original studies comparing patients treated for emergency vs. elective IH were included. Study screening was performed using ASReview®. Data were pooled using random-effects models.                                            Results                Seventeen studies assessing 88,743 patients were included. Emergency IH patients were significantly older (MD 4.51 years; 95%CI 2.38–6.64. I2: 62%), more frequently women (RR 0.76; 95%CI 0.61–0.94. I2: 73%), and had a higher prevalence of ASA score III-IV (RR 1.38; 95%CI 1.03–1.84. I2: 30%). Furthermore, emergency surgery was associated with a longer hospital stay (MD 4.61 days; 95%CI 3.78–5.45. I2: 0%), higher need for reoperation (RR 2.20; 95%CI 1.73–2.80.

Conclusion                Emergent IH repair was associated with worse postoperative outcomes and higher mortality than elective repair. Nevertheless, scarcity of data precluded the inclusion of additional factors (type of repair, hernia size) and stratified/meta-regression analysis by relevant variables (age, sex, surgical risk).

MetaMate utilizes a hierarchical schema and divide-and-conquer approach in its extraction chain, and a from-global-to-local lens and example retriever in its verification chain. We evaluated MetaMate’s performance on 32 empirical studies, extracting 20 data elements related to participants and interventions. MetaMate achieved high precision, recall, and F1 scores, with performance comparable to human coders when benchmarked against an expert-defined gold standard. Notably, MetaMate demonstrated advanced mathematical reasoning and semantic comprehension, surpassing keyword-based approaches and avoiding common human errors. As the first LLM-powered data extraction tool designed specifically for educational research, MetaMate has the potential to significantly streamline the systematic review process and reduce time and effort for researchers.

To achieve these aims, a systematic literature search for qualitative, quantitative, and mixed method studies was performed up to 19 April 2021. To be included in the current review, studies had to be of empirical nature and published in either English or Dutch. ASReview was used to facilitate the inclusion process, a reference check of the included studies was performed, and all included studies in prior reviews on this topic were checked for inclusion. This process resulted in 51 included studies. Relevant study and sample characteristics, information on risk and protective factors, and indicated entry mechanisms were derived from the included studies. In line with earlier reviews, we find relatively strong evidence that being male, belonging to an ethnic minority group, committing certain crimes prior to entry at a young(er) age, committing multiple offenses without being specialized, and having a criminally involved family and/or friends are risk factors for entering OCGs. Entering OCGs occurs via four different entry mechanisms: active recruitment, soliciting for membership, growing into and self-setup. Based on the included studies, the risk and protective factors for entering OCGs that are associated with these different entry mechanisms into OCGs seem to overlap. Although the current review provides grounds to suggest that, in addition to a general set of risk and protective factors for entering OCGs, there might be different risk and protective factors associated with different entry mechanisms, longitudinal prospective studies are needed to substantiate this suggestion.","2024-06-05","2024-09-05 11:38:06","2025-03-26 08:57:53","2024-09-05 11:38:06","14773708241250278","","","","","European Journal of Criminology","The risk and protective factors for entering organized crime groups and their association with different entering mechanisms","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Treatment adherence can be described as the extent to which a patient’s behavior of taking medications follows the agreed recommendations from the healthcare provider. However, non-adherent behavior is estimated to affect up to 50% of patients with chronic conditions, leading to poorer health outcomes among patients, higher rates of hospitalization, and increased mortality. In fact, 200.000 premature deaths each year in the European Union are related to non-adherence. A promising approach to understand adherence behavior of patients represent artificial intelligence and computational techniques. These techniques can be especially useful in analyzing large amounts of heterogeneous patient data, identifying both inter and intra-relationships between factors and patterns associated with non-adherence.                                      Objective              This study offers a provision of a structured overview of the computational methods and techniques used to build predictive models of treatment adherence of patients.                                      Methodology              A scoping review was conducted, and the following databases were searched to identify relevant publications: PubMed, IEEE and Web of Science. The screening of publications consisted of two steps. First, the hits obtained from the search were independently screened and selected using an open-source machine learning (ML)-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview, Active learning for Systematic Reviews. Publications selected for further review were those highly prioritized by ASReview.                                      Results              45 papers were selected into the second round of screening were reviewers performed the full-text screening. The final review included 29 papers. The findings suggest supervised learning (regression and classification) to be the most used analytical approach. Over 54% of adherence topics being related to chronic metabolic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Most assessed predictors were both treatment and socio-demographic and economic-related factors followed by condition-related factors. The selection of a particular computational technique was based on the research question, the type of data available and the desired outcome. A limitation of the reviewed studies is the lack of accountancy for interrelationships between different determinants of adherence behavior. Adherence behavior is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by multiple factors, and it is likely that these factors interact with one another in complex ways.                                      Conclusion              The creation of systems to accurately predict treatment adherence can pave the way for improved therapeutic outcomes, reduced healthcare costs and enabling personalized treatment plans. This paper can support to understand the efforts made in the field of modeling adherence-related factors. In particular, the results provide a structured overview of the computational methods and techniques used to build predictive models of treatment adherence of patients in order to guide future advancements in healthcare.","2024-06-10","2024-09-05 11:36:45","2025-03-26 08:57:10","2024-09-05 11:36:44","","","","","","","Methods and computational techniques for predicting adherence to treatment","","","","","","","en","","","","","Health Informatics","","","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked; scoping_review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large language models (LLMs) are an emerging technology with promising capabilities for the automation of language-related tasks that may be useful for such a purpose.                                            Methods                LLMs were used as part of an automated system to evaluate the relevance of publications to a certain topic based on defined criteria and based on the title and abstract of each publication. A Python script was created to generate structured prompts consisting of text strings for instruction, title, abstract, and relevant criteria to be provided to an LLM. The relevance of a publication was evaluated by the LLM on a Likert scale (low relevance to high relevance). By specifying a threshold, different classifiers for inclusion/exclusion of publications could then be defined. The approach was used with four different openly available LLMs on ten published data sets of biomedical literature reviews and on a newly human-created data set for a hypothetical new systematic literature review.                                            Results                The performance of the classifiers varied depending on the LLM being used and on the data set analyzed. Regarding sensitivity/specificity, the classifiers yielded 94.48%/31.78% for the FlanT5 model, 97.58%/19.12% for the OpenHermes-NeuralChat model, 81.93%/75.19% for the Mixtral model and 97.58%/38.34% for the Platypus 2 model on the ten published data sets. The same classifiers yielded 100% sensitivity at a specificity of 12.58%, 4.54%, 62.47%, and 24.74% on the newly created data set. Changing the standard settings of the approach (minor adaption of instruction prompt and/or changing the range of the Likert scale from 1–5 to 1–10) had a considerable impact on the performance.                                            Conclusions                LLMs can be used to evaluate the relevance of scientific publications to a certain review topic and classifiers based on such an approach show some promising results. To date, little is known about how well such systems would perform if used prospectively when conducting systematic literature reviews and what further implications this might have. However, it is likely that in the future researchers will increasingly use LLMs for evaluating and classifying scientific publications.","2024-06-15","2024-09-05 11:32:56","2025-03-26 09:16:04","2024-09-05 11:32:55","158","","1","13","","Syst Rev","Title and abstract screening for literature reviews using large language models","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","stefano_checked; systematic_reviews_with_LLM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Shifting consumers towards more sustainable food consumption and avoiding food waste and loss (FWL) have been identified as two key levers to tackle climate change at the individual and household level. While the IPCC estimates substantial “technical potential” to reduce emissions via changes in diets and reductions in FWL, there is a lack of learning on which climate solutions can best harness this potential. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to synthesise the empirical literature reporting on demand-side interventions targeting sustainble food consumption and food waste behaviours of individuals and households. The review encompasses empirical research evaluating a wide range of policy interventions targeted at changing actual food consumption and waste behaviours, which have the potential to contribute towards climate change mitigation. The review forms part of an ‘ecosystem of reviews’, a large-scale evidence synthesis initiative seeking to provide a comprehensive analysis of household-scale interventions and their emissions reduction potential. The reviews within the ecosystem utilise state-of-the-art AI-assisted screening procedures and follow a set of harmonised inclusion criteria.","2022-12-05","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Research Square (United States)","","","","Environmental Innovation; Green Consumption; Pro-environmental Behavior; Sustainable Behavior; Waste Reduction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, there are several methodological resources available from international organizations such as the Cochrane Collaboration that aim to aid researchers in conducting high-quality secondary research and promoting reproducibility, transparency and scientific rigour. Nevertheless, researchers still face challenges in most stages of evidence synthesis. Open research and the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles are rising initiatives being increasingly implemented in primary research. However, their beneficial role in secondary research is less emphasized. This article addresses how the challenges commonly faced during evidence synthesis research could be overcome using open research practices and currently available open research tools. Despite the phenomenally simple SR workflow, researchers still find tasks such as framing the SR research question, search strategy development, data extraction, and assessing for bias, challenging. The implementation of FAIR practices, including prospective registration at the PROSPERO database, abiding with the PRISMA guidelines, and making all SR data openly available could have significant benefits in avoiding duplication of effort and reducing research waste while improving the reporting standards of SRs. Additionally, this article highlights the need for further education in open research culture to overcome ethical and motivational barriers in implementing open research practices in evidence synthesis. Finally, in the era of technological breakthroughs, artificial intelligence may eventually be incorporated into the process of SRs and should abide by the FAIR standards for open research.</ns4:p>","2022-12-05","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","1435-1435","","","11","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Faculty of 1000","","","","Evidence Synthesis; Research Methodology; Scientific Workflows","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accordingly, there is a growing trend worldwide among healthcare agencies and decision-makers to require them in order to make informed decisions. Because these reviews are labor-intensive and time consuming, we applied advanced analytic methods (AAM) to determine if machine learning methods could classify abstracts as well as humans. Literature searches were run for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treatments (mNSCLC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Records were reviewed by humans and two AAMs. AAM-1 involved a pre-trained data-mining model specialized in biomedical literature, and AAM-2 was based on support vector machine algorithms. The AAMs assigned an accept/reject status, with reasons for exclusion. Automatic results were compared to those of humans. For mNSCLC, 5820 records were processed by humans and 440 (8%) records were accepted and the remaining items rejected. AAM-1 correctly accepted 6% of records and correctly excluded 79%. AAM-2 correctly accepted 6% of records and correctly excluded 82%. The review was completed by AAM-1 or AAM-2 in 52 hours, compared to 196 hours for humans. Work saved was estimated to be 76% and 79% by AAM-1 and AAM-2, respectively. For mCRPC, 2434 records were processed by humans and 26% of these were accepted and 74% rejected. AAM-1 correctly accepted 23% of records and rejected 62%. AAM-2 correctly accepted 20% of records and rejected 66%. The review was completed by AAM-1, AAM-2, and humans in 25, 25 and 85 hours, respectively. Work saved was estimated to be 61% and 68% by AAM-1 and AAM-2, respectively. AAMs can markedly reduce the time required for searching and triaging records during a systematic review. Methods similar to AAMs should be assessed in future research for how consistent their performances are in SLRs of economic, epidemiological and humanistic evidence.","2021-09-30","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","Information Retrieval; Machine Learning Interpretability; Machine Translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implementation science knowledge is needed to optimize the real-world outcomes of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for informal caregivers. This scoping review aims to systematically synthesize the literature that reports implementation strategies employed to deliver home- and community-based EBIs for informal caregivers of PwD, implementation outcomes, and the barriers and facilitators to implementation of these EBIs. Methods Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to March 2021; included studies focused on “implementation science,” “home- and community-based interventions,” and “informal caregivers of people with dementia.” Titles and abstracts were screened using ASReview (an innovative AI-based tool for evidence reviews), and data extraction was guided by the ERIC taxonomy, the Implementation Outcome Framework, and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science Research; each framework was used to examine a unique element of implementation. Results Sixty-seven studies were included in the review. Multicomponent (26.9%) and eHealth (22.3%) interventions were most commonly reported, and 31.3% of included studies were guided by an implementation science framework. Training and education-related strategies and provision of interactive assistance were the implementation strategy clusters of the ERIC taxonomy where most implementation strategies were reported across the reviewed studies. Acceptability (82.1%), penetration (77.6%), and appropriateness (73.1%) were the most frequently reported implementation outcomes. Design quality and packaging (intervention component suitability) and cosmopolitanism (partnerships) constructs, and patient’s needs and resources and available resources (infrastructure) constructs as per the CFIR framework, reflected the most frequently reported barriers and facilitators to implementation. Conclusion Included studies focused largely on intervention outcomes rather than implementation outcomes and lacked detailed insights on inner and outer setting determinants of implementation success or failure. Recent publications suggest implementation science in dementia research is developing but remains in nascent stages, requiring future studies to apply implementation science knowledge to obtain more contextually relevant findings and to structurally examine the mechanisms through which implementation partners can strategically leverage existing resources and regional networks to streamline local implementation. Mapping local evidence ecosystems will facilitate structured implementation planning and support implementation-focused theory building.

Well-performing natural language processing (NLP) tools for systematic reviews have been developed, showing promise to improve efficiency. However, the feasibility and value of these technologies have not been comprehensively demonstrated in a real-world review. We developed an NLP-assisted abstract screening tool that provides text inclusion recommendations, keyword highlights, and visual context cues. We evaluated this tool in a living systematic review on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, conducting a quality improvement assessment of screening with and without the tool. We evaluated changes to abstract screening speed, screening accuracy, characteristics of included texts, and user satisfaction. The tool improved efficiency, reducing screening time per abstract by 45.9% and decreasing inter-reviewer conflict rates. The tool conserved precision of article inclusion (positive predictive value; 0.92 with tool vs 0.88 without) and recall (sensitivity; 0.90 vs 0.81). The summary statistics of included studies were similar with and without the tool. Users were satisfied with the tool (mean satisfaction score of 4.2 / 5). We evaluated an abstract screening process where one human reviewer was replaced with the tool’s votes, finding that this maintained recall (0.92 one-person, one-tool vs 0.90 two tool-assisted humans) and precision (0.91 vs 0.92) while reducing screening time by 70%. Implementing an NLP tool in this living systematic review improved efficiency, maintained accuracy, and was well-received by researchers, demonstrating the real-world effectiveness of NLP in expediting evidence synthesis.","2022-02-25","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","Fact-Checking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This scoping review maps and assesses the variables that predict police response time. Methods This review considers empirical studies, written in english, that include quantitative data from which an association between the outcome variable police response time and any predictor can be observed or derived. This review provides both a narrative synthesis as well as what we termed a hybrid synthesis , a novel way of synthesizing a large quantitative dataset which is considered too rich for a mere narrative synthesis and yet does not allow for meta-analysis. Results The search, screening and selection process yielded 39 studies, which presented 630 associations between 122 unique predictor variables and police response time. In order to present the results in a digestible way, we classified these into categories and subcategories. All methodological steps and the findings are made public: https://github.com/timverlaan/prt . Conclusions Most of the conclusion and discussion focuses on lessons learned and recommendations for future research, as it proved hard to draw any definitive conclusions on causal factors related to police response time. We recommend that future studies clearly describe mechanisms, focus on the components of police response time (reporting time, dispatch time, travel time—or a combination of these), attempt to standardize predictors and outcome variables, and we call for more research into reporting time . We conclude this review with a first attempt at deriving a causal model of police response time from the subcategories of predictor variables we observed in the empirical studies included in this review.

No analytic feature guidelines currently exist to aid researchers. We performed a systematic review of UCV literature to identify and classify the features researchers have identified as necessary for the analysis of UCV.The literature search followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We looked for articles with the terms 'medical practice variation' and 'unwarranted clinical variation' from four databases: Medline, Web of Science, EMBASE and CINAHL. The search was performed on 24 March 2023. The articles selected were original research articles in the English language reporting on UCV analysis in adult populations. Most of the studies were retrospective cohort analyses. We excluded studies reporting geographic variation based on the Atlas of Variation or small-area analysis methods. We used ASReview Lab software to assist in identifying articles for abstract review. We also conducted subsequent reference searches of the primary articles to retrieve additional articles.The search yielded 499 articles, and we reviewed 46. We identified 28 principal analytic features utilized to analyze for unwarranted variation, categorised under patient-related or local healthcare context factors. Within the patient-related factors, we identified three subcategories: patient sociodemographics, clinical characteristics, and preferences, and classified 17 features into seven subcategories. In the local context category, 11 features are classified under two subcategories. Examples are provided on the usage of each feature for analysis.Twenty-eight analytic features have been identified, and a categorisation has been established showing the relationships between features. Identifying and classifying features provides guidelines for known confounders during analysis and reduces the steps required when performing UCV analysis; there is no longer a need for a UCV researcher to engage in time-consuming feature engineering activities.","2023-11-07","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","251-259","","2","30","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Clinical Indicators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leads to uncertainty among firms when transforming into platform-based ecosystems. The article presents a structuralist approach to conceptualize the platform-based ecosystem construct, giving an overview of the literature landscape in a model bundled with unified terminology and different perspectives. The holistic process model aggregates the findings of 130 papers regarding platform-based ecosystem literature. It consists of 4 phases and 16 design elements that unify different terminologies from various research disciplines in one framework and provide a structured and process-oriented approach. Besides, use cases for different design elements were developed to make the model apply in an I4.0 context. Use Case I is a methodology that can be used to model and validate usage hypotheses based on usage data to derive optimization potential from identified deviations from real product usage. By collecting and refining data for analyzing different manufacturing applications and machine tool behavior the importance of specific data is shown in Use Case II and it is highlighted which data can be shared from an external perspective. Use Case III deals with strategic modeling of platform-based ecosystems and the research identifies control points that platform players can actively set to adjust their business models within alliance-driven cooperation to create and capture value jointly. Use Case IV investigates the status quo and expectations regarding platform-based ecosystems in the field of laser technology with the help of structured expert interviews. Overall, this chapter presents a framework on industrial platform-based ecosystems that gives researchers and practitioners a tool and specific examples to get started in this emerging topic.","2023-12-30","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","491-512","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Nature","","en","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-031-44497-5_20","","","","Ecosystem Innovation; Platform-Based Product Development","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the influence of SP and determining best practices and processes is challenging due to variability in its delivery, implementation, and intervention characteristics between different studies and countries. This study aimed to identify the intervention characteristics, mechanisms, and outcomes associated with SP research, and explore how these factors relate to the influence of SP on health and wellbeing, healthcare utilization, and care experiences. Method A comprehensive search was conducted in 12 databases, Google Scholar, and reference lists of relevant studies published from January 2010 up to April 2023. Searches were limited to literature written in English or Dutch. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and the risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane RoB2 and the ROBINS-I. We coded all intervention characteristics, mechanisms, and relevant outcomes. Qualitative data were visually presented using Harvest Plots and qualitative data were narratively summarized. Results and discussion In total, 49 papers were included, of which seven qualitative, seventeen quantitative, and 25 mixed method studies. Moreover, the findings highlights the importance of social-related mechanisms, including loneliness and social connectedness, in contributing to the observed positive influence of SP on mental health and wellbeing. The observed outcomes seem to be influenced by various characteristics, including gender, age, the presence of a link worker, and the use of behavior change techniques. However, we should be cautious when interpreting these results due to limitations in study designs, such as the lack of controlled trials and statistical considerations. Further rigorous research is needed to comprehensively understand the impact and potential benefits of SP.","2023-11-17","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","Social Prescribing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implementing prevention programs during early childhood may prevent internalizing problems. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of both targeted and universal prevention programs in preventing internalizing problems for children aged 3- to 5-years and their parents. Methods PsycINFO, Embase, and MEDLINE were systematically searched, and 17 randomized control trials, consisting of 3,381 children, met eligibility criteria. There were seven universal prevention programs, and 10 targeted prevention programs. Four prevention programs were delivered to children, 10 prevention programs were delivered to parents/caregivers, and three prevention programs were delivered to both parents and children. Results Prevention programs led to significantly fewer internalizing problems at 6- and 7-month post-intervention ( n = 7, p = 0.02, CI −0.69, 0.06) with a small-to-moderate effect size ( g = −0.38), however, not at post-intervention or at 12-month follow up. Discussion Overall, findings suggest that there may be value in ongoing development and evaluation of prevention programs for internalizing problems, as they improve social and emotional wellbeing in students and reduce internalizing difficulties within the 6- to 7-month timeframe following prevention programs.

This study aimed to develop and externally validate a method using large language models to classify abstracts for diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) systematic reviews, thereby reducing the human workload. We used a previously collected dataset for developing DTA abstract classifiers and applied prompt engineering. We developed an optimized meta-prompt for Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to classify abstracts. In the external validation dataset 1, the prompt with GPT-3.5 turbo showed a sensitivity of 0.988, and a specificity of 0.298. GPT-4 showed a sensitivity of 0.982, and a specificity of 0.677. In the external validation dataset 2, GPT-3.5 turbo showed a sensitivity of 0.919, and a specificity of 0.434. GPT-4 showed a sensitivity of 0.806, and a specificity of 0.740. If we included eligible studies from among the references of the identified studies, GPT-3.5 turbo had no critical misses, while GPT-4 had some misses. Our study indicates that GPT-3.5 turbo can be effectively used to classify abstracts for DTA systematic reviews. Further studies using other dataset are warranted to confirm our results. Additionally, we encourage the use of our framework and publicly available dataset for further exploration of more effective classifiers using other LLMs and prompts ( https://github.com/youkiti/ARE/ ). Hightlights What is already known - Title and abstract screening in systematic reviews (SRs) consumes significant time. - Several attempts using machine learning to reduce this process in diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) SRs exist, but they have not yielded positive results in external validation. What is new - We aimed to develop and externally validate optimized meta-prompt for GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 to classify abstracts for DTA SRs. - Through an iterative approach across three training datasets, an optimal meta-prompt capable of identifying DTA studies with remarkable sensitivity and specificity was developed. - The accuracy reproduced in the external validation datasets.

To address these shortcomings, we developed a novel, semi-automated approach to synthesizing causal evidence from policy-relevant documents. Specifically, we propose the use of natural language processing (NLP) for the extraction of causal evidence and subsequent homogenization or normalization of the varied text, causal mapping for the collation, visualization, and summarization of complex interdependencies within the policy system, and graph analytics for further investigation of the structure and dynamics of the causal map. We illustrate this approach by applying it to a collection of 28 articles on the emissions trading scheme (ETS), a policy instrument of increasing importance for climate change mitigation. In all, we find 300 variables and 284 cause-effect pairs in our input dataset (consisting of 4524 sentences), which are reduced to 70 unique variables and 119 cause-effect pairs after normalization. We create a causal map depicting these and analyze it subsequently to obtain systemic perspective as well as policy-relevant insight on the ETS that is broadly consistent with select manually conducted, previous meta-reviews of the policy instrument. We conclude that, despite its present limitations, this approach can help synthesize causal evidence for policy analysis, policymaking, and policy research.","2023-08-23","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Research Square (United States)","","","","Policy Instruments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Described from a biopsychosocial perspective, we found inconsistent associations between other variables and HRQL outcomes. This can be explained by different studies classifying different groups differently.To be able to compare HRQL outcomes of childhood cancer patients internationally we recommend the use of a paediatric cancer PROM core set.","2023-12-01","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","100134-100134","","","2","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology; Childhood Cancer; Childhood Cancer Survivor Study; Health-Related Quality of Life; Treatment Outcomes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, screening for relevant scientific literature from paper candidates remains an extremely time-consuming process so the task of screening prioritization has been established to reduce the human workload. Various methods under the human-in-the-loop fashion are proposed to solve this task by using lexical features. These methods, even though achieving better performance than more sophisticated feature-based models such as BERT, omit rich and essential semantic information, therefore suffered from feature bias. In this study, we propose a novel framework SciMine to accelerate this screening process by capturing semantic feature representations from both background and the corpus. In particular, based on contextual representation learned from the pre-trained language models, our approach utilizes an autoencoder-based classifier and a feature-dependent classification module to extract general document-level and phrase-level information. Then a ranking ensemble strategy is used to combine these two complementary pieces of information. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that SciMine achieves state-of-the-art performance and comprehensive analysis further shows the efficacy of SciMine to solve feature bias.","2023-07-18","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Information Retrieval; Named Entity Recognition; Semantic Web; Text Mining; Topic Modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We aimed to provide an up-to-date overview of the efficacy and safety of all available maternal vaccines. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and ClinicalTrials.gov on 1 February 2022, for phase III and IV randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared maternal vaccination against any pathogen with placebo or no vaccination. Primary outcomes were laboratory-confirmed or clinically confirmed disease in mothers and infants. Secondary safety outcomes included intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, maternal death, preterm birth, congenital malformations and infant death. Random effects meta-analysis were used to calculate pooled risk ratio’s (RR). Quality appraisal was performed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results Six RCTs on four maternal vaccines, influenza, tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap), pneumococcal and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were eligible. The overall risk of bias and certainty of evidence varied from low to high. Maternal influenza vaccination significantly reduced the number of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.79, event rate 57 vs 98, 2 RCTs, n=6003, I 2 =0%), and clinically confirmed influenza cases in mothers (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.99, event rate 418 vs 472, 2 RCTs, n=6003, I 2 =0%), and laboratory-confirmed influenza in infants (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.85, event rate 98 vs 148, 2 RCTs, n=5883, I 2 =0%), although this was not significant for clinically confirmed influenza in infants (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.05, event rate 1371 vs 1378, 2 RCTs, n=5883, I 2 =0%). No efficacy data were available on maternal Tdap vaccination. Maternal pneumococcal vaccination did not reduce laboratory-confirmed and clinically confirmed middle ear disease (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.02, event rate 9 vs 18, 1 RCT, n=133 and RR 0.88 95% CI 0.69 to 1.12, event rate 42 vs 47, 1 RCT, n=133, respectively), and clinically confirmed lower-respiratory tract infection (LRTI) (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.43, event rate 18 vs 34, 1 RCT, n=70) in infants. Maternal RSV vaccination did not reduce laboratory-confirmed RSV LRTI in infants (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.01, event rate 103 vs 71, 1 RCT, n=4527). There was no evidence of a significant effect of any of the maternal vaccines on the reported safety outcomes.

This study aims to estimate the clinical validity (CV) and clinical utility (CU) of ctDNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) for oncogenic driver mutations to inform 1L treatment decisions in aNSCLC through a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE and Embase to identify randomized control trials or observational studies reporting CV/CU on ctDNA testing in patients with aNSCLC. Meta-analyses were performed using bivariate random-effects models to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity. Progression-free/overall survival (PFS/OS) was summarized for CU studies.Eighteen studies were identified: 17 CV only, 2 CU only, and 1 both. Thirteen studies were included for the meta-analysis on multi-gene detection. The overall sensitivity and specificity for ctDNA detection of any mutation were 0.69 (95% CI, 0.63-0.74) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97-1.00) respectively. However, sensitivity varied greatly by driver gene, ranging from 0.29 (95% CI, 0.13-0.53) for ROS 1 to 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63-0.86) for KRAS . Two studies compared PFS with ctDNA versus tissue-based testing followed by 1L targeted therapy found no significant differences. One study reported OS curves on ctDNA-matched and tissue-matched therapies but no hazard ratios were provided.ctDNA testing demonstrated an overall acceptable diagnostic accuracy in aNSCLC patients, however, sensitivity varied greatly by driver mutation.

Communication helps providers bond with patients, forming therapeutic relationships that benefit patient-centred outcomes. The information exchanged between the provider and patient can help in medical decision-making, such as better self-management. This systematic review investigated the effects of quality and effective communication on patient-centred outcomes among older patients. Methods : Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched using keywords like ""effective communication,"" ""elderly,"" and ""well-being."" Studies published between 2000 and 2023 describing or investigating communication strategies between older patients (65 years and above) and providers in various healthcare settings were considered for selection. The quality of selected studies was assessed using the GRADE Tool. Results : The search strategy yielded seven studies. Four studies were qualitative (one phenomenological study, one ethnography, and two grounded theory studies), one was a cross-sectional observational study, one was an experimental study, and the final was a quantitative study (unclear design). The studies investigated the effects of verbal and nonverbal communication strategies between patients and providers on various patient-centred outcomes, such as patient satisfaction, quality of care, quality of life, and physical and mental health. All the studies reported that various verbal and non-verbal communication strategies positively impacted all patient-centred outcomes. Conclusion : Although the selected studies supported the positive impact of effective communication with older adults on patient-centred outcomes, they had various methodological setbacks that need to be bridged in the future. Future studies should utilize experimental approaches, generalizable samples, and specific effect size estimates.","2023-05-05","2024-06-05 08:33:32","2024-06-05 08:33:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Research Square (United States)","","","","Communication Strategies; Patient Experience; Patient Participation; Patient Satisfaction; Physician Communication","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Emerging technologies, changing organizational structures and dynamic work environments bring opportunities and pose new challenges to organizations. Such developments, together with the growing volume and variety of the exchanged data, mainly yield complexity. This complexity often represents a solid barrier to efficiency and impedes understanding, controlling, and improving processes in organizations. Hence, organizations are prevailingly seeking to identify and avoid unnecessary complexity, which is an odd mixture of different factors. Similarly, in research, much effort has been put into measuring, reviewing, and studying complexity. However, these efforts are highly fragmented and lack a joint perspective. Further, this negatively affects the complexity research acceptance by practitioners. In this study, we extend the body of knowledge on complexity research and practice addressing its high fragmentation. In particular, a comprehensive literature analysis of complexity research is conducted to capture different types of complexity in organizations. The results are comparatively analyzed, and a morphological box containing three aspects and ten features is developed. In addition, an established multi-dimensional complexity framework is employed to synthesize the results. Using the findings from these analyses and adopting the Goal Question Metric, we propose a method for complexity management. This method serves to provide key insights and decision support in the form of extensive guidelines for addressing complexity. Thus, our findings can assist organizations in their complexity management initiatives.","2021-10-16","2022-02-15 16:03:56","2025-03-13 15:01:44","","423-423","","10","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","Complex Systems; Organizational Learning; Organizational Resilience; Problem Structuring Methods; Supply Network Complexity; peer_reviewed_article; other","/unread; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, LRs, especially traditional systematic reviews are slow, resource intensive, and are outdated quickly. Objective Using recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Unsupervised Machine Learning (UML) methods, this paper presents a tool named LiteRev that supports researchers in conducting LRs. Methods Based on the user’s query, LiteRev can perform an automated search on different open-access databases and retrieve relevant metadata on the resulting papers. Papers (abstracts or full texts) are text processed and represented as a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) matrix. Using dimensionality reduction (PaCMAP) and clustering (HDBSCAN) techniques, the corpus is divided into different topics described by a list of keywords. The user can select one or several topics of interest, enter additional keywords to refine their search, or provide key papers to the research question. Based on these inputs, LiteRev performs an iterative nearest neighbours search, and suggests a list of potentially interesting papers. The user can tag the relevant ones and trigger a new search until no additional paper is suggested for screening. To assess the performance of LiteRev, we ran it in parallel to a manual LR on the burden and care for acute and early HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the performance of LiteRev using True and False Predictive Values, recall and Work Saved over Sampling. Results We extracted, text processed and represented into a TF-IDF matrix 631 unique papers from PubMed. The topic modelling module identified 5 main topics and 16 topics (ranging from 13 to 98 papers) and extracted the 10 most important keywords for each. Then, based on 18 key papers, we were able to identify 2 topics of interest with 7 key papers in each of them. Finally, we ran the k-nearest neighbours module and LiteRev suggested first a list of 110 papers for screening, among which 45 papers were confirmed as relevant. From these 45 papers, LiteRev suggested 26 additional papers, out of which 8 were confirmed as relevant. At the end of the iterative process (4 iterations), 193 papers out of 613 papers in total (31.5% of the whole corpus) were suggested by LiteRev. After title/abstract screening, LiteRev identified 64 out of the 87 relevant papers (i.e., recall of 73.6%). After full text screening, LiteRev identified 42 out of the 48 relevant papers (i.e., recall of 87.5%, and Work Saved over Sampling of 56.0%).

We also performed a subgroup analysis based on the type of HSI. We performed descriptive statistics to report the study outcomes using Excel (Microsoft 365). Results A total of 7550 primary studies were identified from the 374 Systematic reviews that met the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 7380 were journal publications that have been indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed (75.1%), Scopus (74.5%), Sciences Citation Index, SCI (54.7%), Embase (48.1%), and CINAHL (34.9%). Only 83 out of 7380 (1.1%) studies were published in journals that were uniquely indexed in CINAHL. The percentage of studies that were only available in other databases was 9.7% (Scopus), 4.3% (MEDLINE/PubMed), 1.6% (SCI), and 0.3% (Embase). The number of studies that were unique to CINAHL in specific types of HSI were: 24/1570 (1.5%) for community health services, 20/1520 (1.3%) for preventive health services, 45/3624 (1.2%) for patient care, 8/1173 (0.7%) for mental health services, and 18/2804 (0.6%) for rehabilitation. Conclusion The gain of CINAHL to identify unique primary studies for SR of HSI appears minimal. The impact of missing studies uniquely available in CINAHL on SR summary or magnitude of effect estimates from meta‐analysis requires further investigation.","2023-07-01","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","","","5","1","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: John Wiley & Sons Ltd","","","","Information Seeking Behavior","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective To investigate the sensitivity, specificity and estimate the avoidable workload when using an AI-based large language model (LLM) (Generative Pre-trained Transformer [GPT] version 3.5-Turbo from OpenAI) to perform title and abstract screening in systematic reviews. Data Sources Unannotated bibliographic databases from five systematic reviews conducted by researchers from Cochrane Austria, Germany and France, all published after January 2022 and hence not in the training data set from GPT 3.5-Turbo. Design We developed a set of prompts for GPT models aimed at mimicking the process of title and abstract screening by human researchers. We compared recommendations from LLM to rule out citations based on title and abstract with decisions from authors, with a systematic reappraisal of all discrepancies between LLM and their original decisions. We used bivariate models for meta-analyses of diagnostic accuracy to estimate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. We performed a simulation to assess the avoidable workload from limiting human screening on title and abstract to citations which were not “ruled out” by the LLM in a random sample of 100 systematic reviews published between 01/07/2022 and 31/12/2022. We extrapolated estimates of avoidable workload for health-related systematic reviews assessing therapeutic interventions in humans published per year. Results Performance of GPT models was tested across 22,666 citations. Pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 97.1% (95%CI 89.6% to 99.2%) and 37.7%, (95%CI 18.4% to 61.9%), respectively. In 2022, we estimated the workload of title and abstract screening for systematic reviews to range from 211,013 to 422,025 person-hours. Limiting human screening to citations which were not “ruled out” by GPT models could reduce workload by 65% and save up from 106,268 to 276,053-person work hours (i.e.,66 to 172-person years of work), every year. Conclusions and Relevance AI systems based on large language models provide highly sensitive and moderately specific recommendations to rule out citations during title and abstract screening in systematic reviews. Their use to “triage” citations before human assessment could reduce the workload of evidence synthesis.","2023-12-17","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","Machine Learning Interpretability; Interpretable Models; Model Interpretability; Responsibility in AI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the broader deployment of DNN models on critical applications, the security of DNNs has become an active and yet nascent area. Attacks against DNNs can have catastrophic results, according to recent studies. Poisoning attacks, including backdoor attacks and Trojan attacks, are one of the growing threats against DNNs. Having a wide-angle view of these evolving threats is essential to better understand the security issues. In this regard, creating a semantic model and a knowledge graph for poisoning attacks can reveal the relationships between attacks across intricate data to enhance the security knowledge landscape. In this paper, we propose a DNN poisoning attack ontology (DNNPAO) that would enhance knowledge sharing and enable further advancements in the field. To do so, we have performed a systematic review of the relevant literature to identify the current state. We collected 28,469 papers from the IEEE, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, and from these papers, 712 research papers were screened in a rigorous process, and 55 poisoning attacks in DNNs were identified and classified. We extracted a taxonomy of the poisoning attacks as a scheme to develop DNNPAO. Subsequently, we used DNNPAO as a framework by which to create a knowledge base. Our findings open new lines of research within the field of AI security.","2022-10-31","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","11053-11053","","21","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","Security Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, RCTs of surgery differ from those of medicine in that surgical performance is often assumed to be consistent. Yet, evaluating whether each surgery is performed to the same standard is quite challenging. As a primary issue, the novelty of this review is to emphasize—with a focus on orthopedic trauma—the advantage of having complete intra-operative image documentation, allowing the direct evaluation of the quality of the intra-operative technical performance. The absence of complete intra-operative image documentation leads to the inhomogeneity of case series, yielding inconsistent results due to the impossibility of a secondary analysis. Thus, comparisons and the reproduction of studies are difficult. Access to complete intra-operative image data in surgical RCTs allows not only secondary analysis but also comparisons with similar cases. Such complete data can be included in electronic papers. Offering these data to peers—in an accessible link—when presenting papers facilitates the selection process and improves publications for readers. Additionally, having access to the full set of image data for all presented cases serves as a rich resource for learning. It enables the reader to sift through the information and pinpoint the details that are most relevant to their individual needs, allowing them to potentially incorporate this knowledge into daily practice. A broad use of the concept of complete intra-operative image documentation is pivotal for bridging the gap between clinical research findings and real-world applications. Enhancing the quality of surgical RCTs would facilitate the equalization of evidence acquisition in both internal medicine and surgery. Joint effort by surgeons, scientific societies, publishers, and healthcare authorities is needed to support the ideas, implement economic requirements, and overcome the mental obstacles to its realization.","2023-10-27","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","6809-6809","","21","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","Evidence Synthesis; Diagnostic Accuracy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study, therefore, aims to provide a comprehensive review of academic efforts on cyberbullying definitions, measurements, and their effectiveness in children and adolescents in the past two decades. A systematic review was performed using ASReview, an open source machine learning systematic review system. Three bibliographic citation databases, including Web of Science core collection, PubMed, and EBSCO were adopted for all relevant literature published from January 2001 to August 2021. In total, twenty-five studies, mentioning seventeen cyberbullying measurement scales, met the study collection criteria. The results found that most failed to provide a clear definition of cyberbullying, often providing unclear and inconsistent descriptions for the youth. Similarly, studies found it difficult to clearly reflect the three key elements of bullying, namely: harmfulness, repetitiveness, and the power imbalance between bullies and victims. With regard to cyberbullying types, most presented two or three categories, including victimization, perpetration, and bystanding, while some suggested four types based on the nature of the cyberbullying behavior, including written or verbal, visual or sexual, character impersonation, and exclusion. If characteristics are considered, cyberbullying becomes more specific with multiple categories being proposed, including flaming (or roasting), harassment, denigration, defamation, outing, jokes, online sexual harassment, and cyberstalking. With regard to measurements, many scales have been proposed and frequently refined to capture specific cyberbullying experience of the youth. This study emphasizes the value and importance of providing clear cyberbullying definitions and helps scholars in youth cyberbullying choose appropriate measurement scales.","2022-10-25","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media","","","","Bullying; Cyberbullying","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous research has shown indications of psychopathology, among other personal and contextual factors, as a potential risk factor for perpetrating terrorist and violent extremist crimes. Despite the fact that women have engaged in acts of terrorism and violent extremism throughout history, the vast majority of literature on psychopathology so far has been mainly focused on men with terrorist and violent extremist behavior. As women's engagement in terrorism and violent extremism is increasing, and gender differences in psychopathology in offenders of terrorism or violent extremism may exist based on empirical evidence for such differences in offenders of violence, gender-informed research into psychopathology as a potential risk factor for offending is of pivotal importance for improving the effectiveness of counter-terrorism interventions. The present systematic review was designed to examine what empirical knowledge exists on the presence and potential contributing role of psychopathology in female perpetrators of terrorism or violent extremism.A literature search was conducted to identify primary source studies in PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Sociological Abstracts. ASReview as an artificial intelligence software was used to screen references.In total, eight studies were included, of which only two studies distinguished prevalence rates and types of psychopathology separately for women, indicating personality disorder as most common. All four out of the eight studies that reported on the relationship between psychopathology and terrorism and violent extremism assumed psychopathology to be a contributing factor in engaging in terrorist or violent extremist acts. However, none of these four studies reported on potentially present female-specific mechanisms of the role of psychopathology in offenses.The present systematic review draws the striking conclusion that there is a lack of clearly described empirical studies on psychopathology in female perpetrators of terrorism and violent extremism and emphasizes the importance of more future empirically based inquiries on this topic by the forensic psychiatric field.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=275354, identifier: CRD42021275354.","2023-06-27","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","","","","14","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media","","","","Extremism; Terrorism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study is to develop principles for interprofessional feedback dialogues, to support healthcare education on feedback processes in an interprofessional context. A critical review of the literature on (interprofessional) feedback, and discussions with local experts resulted in an initial framework. This was input for a two-round expert panel with international, leading scholars in the fields of feedback (n = 5) and interprofessional education (n = 5). Experts showed increased agreement and consensus over the rounds resulting in a framework, called the Westerveld framework, structured around seven criteria: Open and respectful; Relevant; Timely; Dialogical; Responsive; Sense making; and Actionable. The framework contains columns with feedback dialogue principles for information givers and users, and columns with additions to be taken into account in an interprofessional healthcare context.

Methods We conducted a pre-registered systematic review of 20 publications containing 20 independent studies and 23 vignette scenarios. Results We find that the majority of studies rely on non-probability convenience sampling, manipulate a combination of procedural justice elements at positive and negative extremes, but often do not address potential confounds or threats to internal validity. The procedural justice manipulations that combine different elements show relatively consistent associations with a range of attitudinal outcomes, whereas the results for manipulations that test individual components of procedural justice (e.g., voice) are more mixed. Conclusions Based on our review, we recommend that future studies using text-based vignettes disaggregate different elements of procedural justice in manipulations, and include a gradient of treatment or behavior (including control) to avoid comparing extremes, to incorporate potential confounders as either fixed covariates or manipulations, and to formally assess the information equivalence assumption using placebo tests.","2022-08-11","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","151-186","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science+Business Media","","","","Procedural Justice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The constant increase in the volume of publications requires the automation of this tedious task, in order to find and extract relevant articles from the pack. This task is critical, as serious Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) still account for a large number of hospital admissions each year.The aim of this study is to develop an augmented intelligence methodology for automatically identifying relevant publications mentioning an established link between a Drug and a Serious Adverse Event, according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) definition of seriousness.The proposed pipeline, called LiSA (for Literature Search Application), is based on three independent deep learning models supporting a precise detection of safety signals in the biomedical literature. By combining a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithms and a modular architecture, the pipeline achieves a precision of 0.81 and a recall of 0.89 at sentences level in articles extracted from PubMed (either abstract or full-text). We also measured that by using LiSA, a medical reviewer increases by a factor of 2.5 the number of relevant documents it can collect and evaluate compared to a simple keyword search. In the interest of re-usability, emphasis was placed on building a modular pipeline allowing the insertion of other NLP modules to enrich the results provided by the system, and extend it to other use cases. In addition, a lightweight visualization tool was developed to analyze and monitor safety signal results.Overall, the generic pipeline and the visualization tool proposed in this article allows for efficient and accurate monitoring of serious adverse drug reactions from the literature and can easily be adapted to similar pharmacovigilance use cases. To facilitate reproducibility and benefit other research studies, we also shared a first benchmark dataset for Serious Adverse Drug Events detection.","2022-12-22","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","","","Drug Safety Surveillance; Pharmacovigilance; Causality Assessment; Drug Target Identification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, especially in communication research, SLRs often include diverse theories and methods, which come with a considerable downside in terms of reproducibility and replicability. As a response to this problem, the present article introduces the method of standardized sampling for systematic literature reviews (STAMP). The method is a structured, four-stage approach that is centered around score-based screening decisions. Originating from principles of standardized content analysis, a method common in communication research, and supplementing established guidelines like Cochrane or PRISMA, the STAMP method contributes to more transparent, reproducible, and replicable SLR sampling processes. As we illustrate throughout the article, the method is adaptable to various SLR types. The article also discusses the method’s limitations, such as potential coder effects and comparatively high resource intensity. To facilitate the application of STAMP, we provide a comprehensive guideline via the Open Science Framework that offers a succinct overview for quick reference and includes practical examples for different types of SLRs.","2024-04-03","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:38:14","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Cogitatio","","","","stefano_checked; systematic_review_methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After a broad search and cleaning of the data, we used active learning using a shallow classifier and labeled the first set of papers. Then, we applied a second screening phase in which we switched to a different active learning model (i.e., a neural net) to identify difficult-to-find papers due to concept ambiguity. In the third round of screening, we checked for incorrectly included/excluded papers in a quality assessment procedure resulting in the final database.

Methods We employ GPT-3.5 as a zero-shot ranker to prioritize candidate studies by aligning abstracts with the selection criteria outlined in an SR protocol. abstract screening was transformed into a novel question-answering (QA) framework, treating each selection criterion as a question addressed by GPT-3.5. The framework involves breaking down the selection criteria into multiple questions, properly prompting GPT-3.5 to answer each question, scoring and re-ranking each answer, and combining the responses to make nuanced inclusion or exclusion decisions. Results Large-scale validation was performed on the benchmark of CLEF eHealth 2019 Task 2: Technology-Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine. Across 31 datasets of four categories of SRs, the proposed QA framework consistently outperformed other zero-shot ranking models. Compared with our QA-based approach exhibited a clear advantage over traditional models and bespoke BERT-family models that were fine-tuned for ranking tasks (i.e., from the BERT to PubMedBERT), underscoring their high potential in facilitating abstract screening. Conclusion Investigation justified the indispensable value of leveraging selection criteria to improve the performance of automated abstract screening. GPT-3.5 demonstrated proficiency in prioritizing candidate studies for abstract screening using the proposed QA framework. Significant performance improvements were obtained by re-ranking answers using the semantic alignment between abstracts and selection criteria. This further highlighted the pertinence of utilizing selection criteria to enhance abstract screening.","2023-12-18","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","Topic Modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A systematic review from 2018 about neuropsychological tests used during awake craniotomy made clear that until 2017 language was most often monitored and that the other cognitive domains were underexposed (Ruis, J Clin Exp Neuropsychol 40(10):1081–1104, 218). The field of awake craniotomy and cognitive monitoring is however developing rapidly. The aim of the current review is therefore, to investigate whether there is a change in the field towards incorporation of new tests and more complete mapping of (higher-order) cognitive functions. Methods We replicated the systematic search of the study from 2018 in PubMed and Embase from February 2017 to November 2023, yielding 5130 potentially relevant articles. We used the artificial machine learning tool ASReview for screening and included 272 papers that gave a detailed description of the neuropsychological tests used during awake craniotomy. Results Comparable to the previous study of 2018, the majority of studies (90.4%) reported tests for assessing language functions (Ruis, J Clin Exp Neuropsychol 40(10):1081–1104, 218). Nevertheless, an increasing number of studies now also describe tests for monitoring visuospatial functions, social cognition, and executive functions. Conclusions Language remains the most extensively tested cognitive domain. However, a broader range of tests are now implemented during awake craniotomy and there are (new developed) tests which received more attention. The rapid development in the field is reflected in the included studies in this review. Nevertheless, for some cognitive domains (e.g., executive functions and memory), there is still a need for developing tests that can be used during awake surgery.","2024-05-07","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:17:54","","","","1","166","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science+Business Media","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, they are labor-intensive because of their collaborative nature, strict protocols, and typically large number of documents. Large language models (LLMs) and their applications such as gpt-4/ChatGPT have the potential to reduce the human workload of the SR process while maintaining accuracy. We propose a new hybrid methodology that combines the strengths of LLMs and humans using the ability of LLMs to summarize large bodies of text autonomously and extract key information. This is then used by a researcher to make inclusion/exclusion decisions quickly. This process replaces the typical manually performed title/abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction steps in an SR while keeping a human in the loop for quality control. We developed a semi-automated LLM-assisted (Gemini-Pro) workflow with a novel innovative prompt development strategy. This involves extracting three categories of information including identifier, verifier, and data field (IVD) from the formatted documents. We present a case study where our hybrid approach reduced errors compared with a human-only SR. The hybrid workflow improved the accuracy of the case study by identifying 6/390 (1.53%) articles that were misclassified by the human-only process. It also matched the human-only decisions completely regarding the rest of the 384 articles. Given the rapid advances in LLM technology, these results will undoubtedly improve over time.","2024-05-12","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:15:39","","167-167","","5","16","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","stefano_checked; systematic_reviews_with_LLM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parents caring for a child with BBDD face multiple challenges that cause increased stress and high risk of mental health problems. Peer-based support by fellow parents for a various range of patient groups has shown potential to provide emotional, psychological and practical support. Here, we aim to explore existing literature on individual peer-to-peer support (iP2PS) interventions for parents caring for children with BBDD with a view to (1) explore the impact of iP2PS interventions on parents and (2) identify challenges and facilitators of iP2PS.An extensive literature search (January 2023) was performed, and a thematic analysis was conducted to synthesize findings.Fourteen relevant articles revealed three major themes regarding the impact of iP2PS on parents: (1) emotional and psychological well-being, (2) quality of life and (3) practical issues. Four themes were identified describing challenges and facilitators of iP2PS: (1) benefits and burden of giving support, (2) matching parent-pairs, (3) logistic challenges and solutions and (4) training and supervision of parents providing peer support.This review revealed that iP2PS has a positive impact on the emotional and psychological well-being of parents, as well as the overall quality of life for families caring for a child with a BBDD. Individual P2PS offers peer-parents an opportunity to support others who are facing challenges similar to those they have experienced themselves. However, many questions still need to be addressed regarding benefits of different iP2PS styles, methods of tailoring support to individual needs and necessity of training and supervision for peer support providers. Future research should focus on defining these components and evaluating benefits to establish effective iP2PS that can be provided as standard care practice for parents.","2024-04-08","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:35:28","","","","3","50","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","stefano_checked; scoping_review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, accumulating evidence showed that the interplay between BAs and bilirubin in these processes involves intricate regulatory mechanisms mediated by specific receptors and signaling pathways under certain conditions and in specific contexts. Oxidative stress plays a significant role in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) due to its role in inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and other risk factors. In the cardiovascular (CV) system, recent studies have suggested that BAs and bilirubin have some opposite effects related to oxidative and inflammatory mechanisms, but this area of research is still under investigation. This review aims to introduce BAs and bilirubin from a biochemical and physiological point of view, emphasizing their potential protective or detrimental effects on CVDs. Moreover, clinical studies that have assessed the association between BAs/bilirubin and CVD were examined in depth to better interpret the possible link between them.","2024-05-14","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:11:32","","103-103","","5","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In March 2022, we searched MEDLINE, Scopus, CENTRAL, CINAHL and Web of Sciences, and trial registries. Record screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were undertaken by two reviewers. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.This systematic review included 18 studies (n = 1465), involving a combination of mixed settings (8 studies), inpatient settings (8 studies), and outpatient settings (2 studies). The studies were at high risk of performance, detection, and reporting biases. Compared to usual care, pulmonary rehabilitation probably improves AECOPD-related hospital readmissions (relative risk 0.56, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.86; moderate certainty evidence) and cardiovascular submaximal capacity (standardized mean difference 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.99; moderate certainty evidence). Low certainty evidence suggests that pulmonary rehabilitation may be beneficial on re-exacerbations, dyspnoea, and impact of disease. The evidence regarding the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation on health-related quality of life and mortality is very uncertain (very low certainty evidence).Our results indicate that pulmonary rehabilitation may be an effective treatment option for individuals with AECOPD, irrespective of setting. Our certainty in this evidence base was limited due to small studies, heterogeneous rehabilitation programs, numerous methodological weaknesses, and a poor reporting of findings that were inconsistent with each other.

Hydrogen is often considered a “missing link” in guaranteeing the energy transition, providing storage, and covering the volatility and intermittency of renewable energy generation. However, due to potential injustice with regard to the distribution of risks, benefits, and costs (i.e., in regard to competing for land use), the large-scale deployment of hydrogen is a contested policy issue. This paper draws from a historical analysis of past energy projects to contribute to a more informed policy-making process toward a more just transition to the hydrogen economy. We perform a systematic literature review to identify relevant conflict factors that can influence the outcome of hydrogen energy transition projects in selected Economic Community of West African States countries, namely Nigeria and Mali. To better address potential challenges, policymakers must not only facilitate technology development, access, and market structures for hydrogen energy policies but also focus on energy access to affected communities. Further research should monitor hydrogen implementation with a special focus on societal impacts in producing countries.","2022-12-03","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","2193-2193","","12","11","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","Hydrogen; Sustainable Energy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Capacity building is the development of knowledge, skills, and structures to improve the capability of individuals and organisations to achieve effective health promotion. This review aimed to determine the efficacy of capacity building interventions on teachers’ and ECEs’ perceived capabilities, knowledge, and attitudes relating to physical activity and fundamental movement skills. Methods An exhaustive literature search of six electronic databases was conducted. Controlled, single-group pre-post studies were included if they measured the effect of a capacity building intervention on in-service or pre-service classroom teachers’ (primary or secondary) or ECEs’ physical activity or fundamental skills related perceived capabilities, knowledge, or attitudes. The effects of interventions were synthesised using random effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression was conducted to determine if the effects differed based on study design, type of teacher (ECE vs. primary school), or teacher level (pre-service vs. in-service). Results A total of 22 studies reporting on 25 unique samples were included in the meta-analyses. Only studies reporting on ECEs and primary school teachers were identified. Interventions most commonly included training/professional development, resources and toolkits, communities of practice, mentorships, and ongoing support. Results showed that capacity building interventions significantly improved teachers’ and ECEs’ perceived capabilities (g = 0.614, 95% CI = 0.442, 0.786), knowledge (g = 0.792 95% CI = 0.459, 1.125), and attitudes (g = 0.376 95% CI = 0.181, 0.571). The effects did not differ significantly as a function of any of the moderators examined. Conclusion Findings from this review provide strong support that capacity building interventions are efficacious at improving teachers’ and ECEs’ perceived capabilities, knowledge, and attitudes related to promoting physical activity and teaching fundamental movement skills. Pre-service teachers and ECEs should be provided training in physical activity and fundamental movement skills as part of their degrees, and continual professional development and capacity building should be offered to in-service teachers and ECEs to promote physical activity and fundamental movement skills in children.","2024-05-27","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:05:40","","","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","","","systematic_review; meta_analysis; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today, digital technologies allow social scientists to track “everyday behavior” and to extract opinions from public discussions on online platforms. These new types of digital traces of human behavior, together with computational methods for analyzing them, have opened new avenues for analyzing, understanding, and addressing social science research questions. However, even the most innovative and extensive amounts of data are hollow if they are not of high quality. But what does data quality mean for modern social science data? To investigate this rather abstract question the present study focuses on four objectives. First, we provide researchers with a decision tree to identify appropriate data quality frameworks for a given use case. Second, we determine which data types and quality dimensions are already addressed in the existing frameworks. Third, we identify gaps with respect to different data types and data quality dimensions within the existing frameworks which need to be filled. And fourth, we provide a detailed literature overview for the intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives on data quality. By conducting a systematic literature review based on text mining methods, we identified and reviewed 58 data quality frameworks. In our decision tree, the three categories, namely, data type, the perspective it takes, and its level of granularity, help researchers to find appropriate data quality frameworks. We, furthermore, discovered gaps in the available frameworks with respect to visual and especially linked data and point out in our review that even famous frameworks might miss important aspects. The article ends with a critical discussion of the current state of the literature and potential future research avenues.","2024-04-27","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:29:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publishing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The approach involves an ML‐driven pipeline that extracts statistical and morphological features from an MS target region and feeds these features into ML algorithms to generate and assess predictive models. The findings demonstrate ML prediction models exhibit superior performance when trained on extracted features versus raw spectra intensity data and that random forest models exhibit robust classification performance in both internal and external validation datasets. These models remain effective across varying training dataset sizes and positive sample rates and are enhanced by a nested active learning approach. This approach can thus revolutionize clinical MS applications.","2024-05-12","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:19:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Wiley","","","","stefano_checked; ASR_inspired","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In acute response studies, postprandial outcomes followed the expected physiological patterns, and outcomes measured over 24 h showed no significant differences. For the RCTs, glucose area under the curve during a glucose tolerance test was slightly, but not significantly lower in preprandial PA vs postprandial PA (-0.29[95 %CI:-0.66, 0.08]mmol/L,I<sup>2</sup> = 64.36 %). Subgroup analyses (quality, health status, etc.) did not significantly change the outcomes. In conclusion, we found no differences between preprandial PA versus postprandial PA on glycaemia both after one PA bout as well as after multiple weeks of PA. The studies were of low to moderate quality of evidence as assessed by GRADE, showed contradictive results, included no long-term studies and used various designs and populations.

Though several notable advancements have already been made, the incorporation of machine learning is less than optimal, still relying on a sequential, staged process designed to accommodate a purely human approach, exemplified by PRISMA. Here, we test a spiral, alternating or oscillating approach, where full-text screening is done intermittently with title/abstract screening, which we examine in three datasets by simulation under 360 conditions comprised of different algorithmic classifiers, feature extractions, prioritization rules, data types, and information provided (e.g., title/abstract, full-text included). Overwhelmingly, the results favored a spiral processing approach with logistic regression, TF-IDF for vectorization, and maximum probability for prioritization. Results demonstrate up to a 90% improvement over traditional machine learning methodologies, especially for databases with fewer eligible articles. With these advancements, the screening component of most systematic reviews should remain functionally achievable for another one to two decades.","2024-01-17","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","","","Scientific Workflows; Machine Learning Interpretability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Digital solutions have the potential to support medical professionals to optimize GDMT prescriptions in a growing HF population. We aimed to review current literature on the effectiveness of digital solutions on optimization of GDMT prescriptions in patients with HF. Recent Findings We report on the efficacy, characteristics of the study, and population of published digital solutions for GDMT optimization. The following digital solutions are discussed: teleconsultation, telemonitoring, cardiac implantable electronic devices, clinical decision support embedded within electronic health records, and multifaceted interventions. Effect of digital solutions is reported in dedicated studies, retrospective studies, or larger studies with another focus that also commented on GDMT use. Overall, we see more studies on digital solutions that report a significant increase in GDMT use. However, there is a large heterogeneity in study design, outcomes used, and populations studied, which hampers comparison of the different digital solutions. Barriers, facilitators, study designs, and future directions are discussed. Summary There remains a need for well-designed evaluation studies to determine safety and effectiveness of digital solutions for GDMT optimization in patients with HF. Based on this review, measuring and controlling vital signs in telemedicine studies should be encouraged, professionals should be actively alerted about suboptimal GDMT, the researchers should consider employing multifaceted digital solutions to optimize effectiveness, and use study designs that fit the unique sociotechnical aspects of digital solutions. Future directions are expected to include artificial intelligence solutions to handle larger datasets and relieve medical professional’s workload.","2024-02-16","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 10:03:07","","147-161","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science+Business Media","","","","stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little is known about the pathways that could lead to their concurrent achievement. We provide an overview of the current literature on quantitative pathways toward the SDGs, indicate the commonly used methods and indicators, and identify the most comprehensive pathways that have been published to date. Our results indicate that there is a need for more scenarios toward the full set of SDGs, using a wider range of underlying narratives. Technical Summary Quantitative goal-seeking scenario studies could help to explore the needed systems' transformations to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by identifying enabling conditions and accounting for the synergies and trade-offs between the SDGs. Given that the SDGs were adopted some time ago, here, we review the existing global scenario literature to determine what it can offer in this context. We found only a few scenarios that address a large set of SDGs, while many more deal with specific clusters of 2–6 SDGs. We identified the most frequent clusters and compared the results of the most comprehensive sustainable development scenarios. The latter is complicated because of the diversity of methods, indicators, and assumptions used. Therefore, we suggest that an effort is needed to develop a wider set of scenarios that would achieve multiple SDGs, using a more standardized framework of targets and indicators.

Producing one-piece hollow profiles with smooth inner surfaces and undercuts presents major challenges for conventional mold concepts. There is yet no thorough review of shape-variable mandrels in composite manufacturing to be found in the literature. This paper provides an overview of research on shape memory polymers and other shape-variable materials used in tooling applications for composite manufacturing. This work covers shape memory, heat shrink, and other deformable tooling concepts that enable the production of one-piece Type V pressure vessels, air intake ducts, or curved struts and tubes. A systematic literature review in combination with a state-of-the-art open-source active learning tool ASReview is conducted. Fifteen relevant studies were identified. Research on shape-variable tooling is mainly conducted by three research groups in the USA and the PRC. The tooling is mostly made of unreinforced thermosets, especially styrene-based ones. Thermoplastic resins are less common, and reinforcements limit the usable elongation in the temporary shape. The shape variability is either a shape memory and/or a softening process, which, in all studies, is activated by heating. Release agents are widely used to ease demolding. No ecological or economical assessment of the manufacturing methods was conducted in the reviewed studies. Three fields for further research that could be identified are as follows: (1) thorough ecological end economical assessment of shape-variable mandrels in comparison with conventional tooling; (2) thermoplastic shape memory polymer mandrels; and (3) further investigation of simulation capabilities for shape memory mandrels.","2024-04-03","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:38:36","","131-131","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We code our literature sample (N = 79) according to the types of demand studied, the spatial scales used, the theories adopted, the methods deployed and the findings reported. We find that most studies focus on crime-related call types using meso-level (e.g., neighborhood) spatial scales. Descriptive methods demonstrate the non-random distribution of calls, irrespective of their type, while correlational findings are mixed, providing minimal support for theories such as social disorganization theory.

Conventional methods deployed to estimate kinetics require complex, expensive systems and are limited to laboratory settings. Alternatively, multiple algorithms have been proposed in the literature to estimate kinetics from kinematics measured using only IMUs. However, the knowledge about their accuracy and generalizability for patient populations is still limited. Therefore, this article aims to identify the available algorithms for the estimation of kinetic parameters using kinematics measured only from IMUs and to evaluate their applicability in ACL rehabilitation through a comprehensive systematic review. The papers identified through the search were categorized based on the modelling techniques and kinetic parameters of interest, and subsequently compared based on the accuracies achieved and applicability for ACL patients during rehabilitation. IMUs have exhibited potential in estimating kinetic parameters with good accuracy, particularly for sagittal movements in healthy cohorts. However, several shortcomings were identified and future directions for improvement have been proposed, including extension of proposed algorithms to accommodate multiplanar movements and validation of the proposed techniques in diverse patient populations and in particular the ACL population.","2024-03-28","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:49:08","","2163-2163","","7","24","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods Across ten academic databases, an electronic search was conducted from inception to 7th January 2024. The proportion of athletes scoring at or above predetermined cutoffs on validated self-reporting screening measures was used to identify disordered eating (DE). Subgroup analysis per country, per culture, and per research measure were also conducted. Age, body mass index (BMI), and sex were considered as associated/correlated factors. Results The mean prevalence of SRDE among 70,957 athletes in 177 studies (132 publications) was 19.23% (17.04%; 21.62%), I 2 = 97.4%, τ 2 = 0.8990, Cochran's Q p value = 0. Australia had the highest percentage of SRDE athletes with a mean of 57.1% (36.0%-75.8%), while Iceland had the lowest, with a mean of 4.9% (1.2%-17.7%). The SRDE prevalence in Eastern countries was higher than in Western countries with 29.1% versus 18.5%. Anaerobic sports had almost double the prevalence of SRDE 37.9% (27.0%-50.2%) compared to aerobic sports 19.6% (15.2%-25%). Gymnastics sports had the highest SRDE prevalence rate, with 41.5% (30.4%-53.6%) while outdoor sports showed the lowest at 15.4% (11.6%-20.2%). Among various tools used to assess SRDE, the three-factor eating questionnaire yielded the highest SRDE rate 73.0% (60.1%-82.8%). Meta-regression analyses showed that female sex, older age, and higher BMI (all p &lt; 0.01) are associated with higher prevalence rates of SRDE. Conclusion The outcome of this review suggests that factors specific to the sport affect eating behaviors throughout an athlete's life. As a result, one in five athletes run the risk of developing an eating disorder.

This paper describes the development and application of machine learning algorithms aimed at semi-automatic selection of abstracts for a meta-analysis on the effects of simulation-based learning in higher education. The goal was to reduce the workload while also maintaining the transparency and objectivity of the selection process. The algorithms were trained, validated, and tested on a set of 3187 studies on simulation-based learning found in medical and educational databases collected before April 2018. Subsequently, they were utilized to classify abstracts for a follow-up meta-analysis consisting of 2373 studies (published between 2018 and 2020). The aim of training the algorithms was to predict studies' abstract eligibility based on words and combinations of words used in these abstracts. The application of the algorithms reduced the number of studies that had to be manually screened from 2373 to 711. A total of 458 studies from automatically selected abstracts were included in the full-text screening, indicating the high precision of the algorithms (also compared to the performance of human raters).

Objective This review aims to provide insights into barriers and facilitators of legal, ethical, financial, and technological aspects for successful implementation of complex eHealth technologies, which impacts multiple levels and multiple stakeholders. Methods A scoping review was conducted by querying PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ACM Digital Library (2018–2023) for studies describing the implementation process of eHealth technologies that facilitate data exchange. Studies solely reporting clinical outcomes or conducted outside Europe were excluded. Two independent reviewers selected the studies. A conceptual framework was constructed through axial and inductive coding, extracting data from literature on legal, ethical, financial, and technological aspects of eHealth implementation. This framework guided systematic extraction and interpretation. Results The search resulted in 7.308 studies that were screened for eligibility, of which 35 (0.48%) were included. Legal barriers revolve around data confidentiality and security, necessitating clear regulatory guidelines. Ethical barriers span consent, responsibility, liability, and validation complexities, necessitating robust frameworks. Financial barriers stem from inadequate funding, requiring (commercial) partnerships and business models. Technological issues include interoperability, integration, and malfunctioning, necessitating strategies for enhancing data reliability, improving accessibility, and aligning eHealth technology with existing systems for smoother integration. Conclusions This research highlights the multifaceted nature of eHealth implementation, encompassing legal, ethical, financial, and technological considerations. Collaborative stakeholder engagement is paramount for effective decision-making and aligns with the transition from standalone eHealth tools to integrated digital health environments. Identifying suitable stakeholders and recognizing their stakes and values enriches implementation strategies with expertise and guidance across all aspects. Future research should explore the timing of these considerations and practical solutions for regulatory compliance, funding, navigation of responsibility and liability, and business models for reimbursement strategies.","2024-03-08","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2025-03-26 09:50:40","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media","","","","stefano_checked; scoping_review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of Artificial Intelligence could make literature processing faster and more efficient. Sentence transformers are groundbreaking algorithms that can generate rich semantic representations of text documents and allow for semantic queries. In the present report, we compared four freely available sentence transformer pre-trained models (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, all-MiniLM-L12-v2, all-mpnet-base-v2, and All-distilroberta-v1) on a convenience sample of 6110 articles from a published systematic review. The authors of this review manually screened the dataset and identified 24 target articles that addressed the Focused Questions (FQ) of the review. We applied the four sentence transformers to the dataset and, using the FQ as a query, performed a semantic similarity search on the dataset. The models identified similarities between the FQ and the target articles to a varying degree, and, sorting the dataset by semantic similarities using the best-performing model (all-mpnet-base-v2), the target articles could be found in the top 700 papers out of the 6110 dataset.

Despite this, the following assessment highlights two challenges for evidence synthesis reviews that are at odds with open science principles: (1) the lack of funding available for evidence synthesis reviews, particularly preclinical reviews, despite their demonstrated value and (2) the slow and expensive traditional publication model. I recommend allocating funding for preclinical evidence synthesis reviews as they are beneficial to both the researchers conducting the review and the field that is being reviewed.

However, these strategies share common underlying behaviors that transcend specific contexts. Building on this understanding, we propose a comprehensive ""holistic life-crafting"" approach that integrates overlapping behaviors from various crafting strategies. This study aims to clarify the theoretical conceptualization of life-crafting by identifying common strategies and behaviors underlying different meaning-making crafting approaches. Through a systematic literature search of six databases between January and April 2022, we identified 16,479 published records. Using predefined inclusion-exclusion criteria, 51 records (reflecting five crafting approaches, resulting in 223 different crafting behaviors) remained. Through content analysis, we grouped these behaviors into seven broader crafting strategies, forming the ""holistic life-crafting"" approach. Findings suggest that life-crafting is a holistic, continuous process of proactive meaning-making by intentionally balancing life demands with available resources and altering life's cognitive, environmental, interest, relational, skill, and task-related aspects to promote personal growth and wellbeing. The holistic approach encompasses cognitive, environmental, interest, relational, resources-demands, skill, and task crafting strategies.

Significant challenges remain, however, especially in the complex socio-technical setting of SMEs. Seemingly basic questions, such as how to aggregate metrics and ensure solution adaptability, are still open to debate. Aggregation and adaptability are vital topics to SMEs, as they require the assimilation of metrics into an actionable advice adapted to their situation and needs. To address these issues, we systematically review socio-technical cybersecurity metric research in this paper. We analyse aggregation and adaptability considerations and investigate how current findings apply to the SME situation. To ensure that we provide valuable insights to researchers and practitioners, we integrate our results in a novel socio-technical cybersecurity framework geared towards the needs of SMEs.

This problem cannot be resolved by improving the way deductive (confirmatory) research is conducted (e.g., through preregistration and replication), because theory formation requires inductive (exploratory) research. This paper argues that machine learning can help advance theory formation in (developmental) psychology, because it enables rigorous exploration of patterns in data. The paper discusses specific advantages of machine learning, explains core methodological concepts, introduces relevant methods, and describes how data‐driven insights are consolidated into theory. Machine learning automates exploration, and incorporates checks and balances to ensure generalizable results.

Therefore, cybersecurity researchers and practitioners need to aid SMEs in their defence against cyber threats. Research has shown that SMEs require solutions that are automated and adapted to their context. In recent years, we have seen a surge in initiatives to share cyber threat intelligence (CTI) to improve collective cybersecurity resilience. Shared CTI has the potential to answer the SME call for automated and adaptable solutions. Sadly, as we demonstrate in this paper, current shared intelligence approaches scarcely address SME needs. We must investigate how shared CTI can be used to improve SME cybersecurity resilience. In this paper, we tackle this challenge using a systematic review to discover current state-of-the-art approaches to using shared CTI. We find that threat intelligence sharing platforms such as MISP have the potential to address SME needs, provided that the shared intelligence is turned into actionable insights. Based on this observation, we developed a prototype application that processes MISP data automatically, prioritises cybersecurity threats for SMEs, and provides SMEs with actionable recommendations tailored to their context. Subsequent evaluations in operational environments will help to improve our application, such that SMEs are enabled to thwart cyberattacks in future.","2021-11-24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","2913-2913","","23","10","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","Business Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Satellite remote sensing (RS) data are increasingly being used to estimate total evaporation, often referred to as evapotranspiration (ET), over large regions. Since RS-based ET (RS-ET) estimation inherits uncertainties from several sources, many available studies have assessed these uncertainties using different methods. However, the suitability of methods and reference data subsequently affects the validity of these evaluations. This study summarizes the status of the various methods applied for uncertainty assessment of RS-ET estimates, discusses the advances and caveats of these methods, identifies assessment gaps, and provides recommendations for future studies. We systematically reviewed 676 research papers published from 2011 to 2021 that assessed the uncertainty or accuracy of RS-ET estimates. We categorized and classified them based on (i) the methods used to assess uncertainties, (ii) the context where uncertainties were evaluated, and (iii) the metrics used to report uncertainties. Our quantitative synthesis shows that the uncertainty assessments of RS-ET estimates are not consistent and comparable in terms of methodology, reference data, geographical distribution, and uncertainty presentation. Most studies used validation methods using eddy-covariance (EC)-based ET estimates as a reference. However, in many regions such as Africa and the Middle East, other references are often used due to the lack of EC stations. The accuracy and uncertainty of RS-ET estimates are most often described by root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs). When validating against EC-based estimates, the RMSE of daily RS-ET varies greatly among different locations and levels of temporal support, ranging from 0.01 to 6.65 mm d−1, with a mean of 1.18 mm d−1. We conclude that future studies need to report the context of validation, the uncertainty of the reference datasets, the mismatch in the temporal and spatial scales of reference datasets to those of the RS-ET estimates, and multiple performance metrics with their variation in different conditions and their statistical significance to provide a comprehensive interpretation to assist potential users. We provide specific recommendations in this regard. Furthermore, extending the application of RS-ET to regions that lack validation will require obtaining additional ground-based data and combining different methods for uncertainty assessment.","2023-12-20","2024-06-05 08:33:24","2024-06-05 08:33:24","","4505-4528","","24","27","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Copernicus Publications","","","","Evapotranspiration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carbon offsets are issued based on ex-ante estimates of project emissions reductions, though systematic evidence on ex-post evaluations of achieved emissions reductions is missing. We synthesized existing rigorous empirical studies evaluating more than 2,000 offset projects across all major offset sectors. Our analysis shows that offset projects achieved considerably lower emissions reductions than officially claimed. We estimate that only 12% of the total volume of existing credits constitute real emissions reductions, with 0% for renewable energy, 0.4% for cookstoves, 25.0% for forestry and 27.5% for chemical processes. Our results thus indicate that 88% of the total credit volume across these four sectors in the voluntary carbon market does not constitute real emissions reductions. This offset achievement gap corresponds to almost twice the annual German CO 2 emissions. We complement evidence from offset projects with 51 additional studies conducting ex-post evaluations of field interventions with settings comparable to offset projects. For cookstoves and forestry projects, these field interventions were more effective at reducing emissions than the voluntary offset projects, likely due to more careful intervention targeting, stricter monitoring and enforcement of intervention protocols.","2023-07-27","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Research Square (United States)","","","","Carbon Pricing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This machine learning-aided review provides an overview of the current state of the literature examining this relationship. We highlight and discuss methodological differences between the studies, including their perspective (top-down or bottom-up), spatial scope, and the respective energy and well-being indicators used. The review reveals that most research takes a top-down perspective, analyzing country-level data across multiple countries. These studies typically find a positive relationship between energy use and well-being, and most confirm the existence of a saturation effect. We reveal that countries in the Global South are underrepresented in current studies. Bottom-up studies focus on specific countries or country groups using household-level data, yielding more nuanced findings that can be further disaggregated by consumption domain.

Using dimensionality reduction (pairwise controlled manifold approximation) and clustering (hierarchical density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) techniques, the corpus is divided into different topics described by a list of the most important keywords. The user can then select one or several topics of interest, enter additional keywords to refine its search, or provide key papers to the research question. Based on these inputs, LiteRev performs a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search and suggests a list of potentially interesting papers. By tagging the relevant ones, the user triggers new k-NN searches until no additional paper is suggested for screening. To assess the performance of LiteRev, we ran it in parallel to a manual LR on the burden and care for acute and early HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the performance of LiteRev using true and false predictive values, recall, and work saved over sampling.LiteRev extracted, processed, and transformed text into a term frequency-inverse document frequency matrix of 631 unique papers from PubMed. The topic modeling module identified 16 topics and highlighted 2 topics of interest to the research question. Based on 18 key papers, the k-NNs module suggested 193 papers for screening out of 613 papers in total (31.5% of the whole corpus) and correctly identified 64 relevant papers out of the 87 papers found by the manual abstract screening (recall rate of 73.6%). Compared to the manual full text screening, LiteRev identified 42 relevant papers out of the 48 papers found manually (recall rate of 87.5%). This represents a total work saved over sampling of 56%.We presented the features and functionalities of LiteRev, an automation tool that uses natural language processing and machine learning methods to streamline and accelerate LRs and support researchers in getting quick and in-depth overviews on any topic of interest.","2023-09-15","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","e39736-e39736","","","25","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: JMIR Publications","","","","Information Retrieval; Machine Translation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The capacity of artificial intelligence to aggregate huge amounts of information is emerging as particularly interesting for processing the volume of information needed to generate MAs. In this study, we analyzed whether the chatbot ChatGPT is able to summarize information in a useful fashion for providers and patients in a way that matches up with the results of MAs/NMAs. Methods: We included 16 studies (13 NMAs and 3 MAs) that evaluate biologics (n = 6) and both biologic and systemic treatment (n = 10) for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, published between January 2021 and May 2023. Results: The conclusions of the MAs/NMAs were compared to ChatGPT’s answers to queries about the molecules evaluated in the selected MAs/NMAs. The reproducibility between the results of ChatGPT and the MAs/NMAs was random regarding drug safety. Regarding efficacy, ChatGPT reached the same conclusion as 5 out of the 16 studies (four out of four studies when three molecules were compared), gave acceptable answers in 7 out of 16 studies, and was inconclusive in 4 out of 16 studies. Conclusions: ChatGPT can generate conclusions that are similar to MAs when the efficacy of fewer drugs is compared but is still unable to summarize information in a way that matches up to the results of MAs/NMAs when more than three molecules are compared.","2023-08-20","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","5410-5410","","16","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","Health Technology Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Two researchers identified the qualified publications independently by abstract and full-text screening with the assistance of an NLP-based AI instrument, ASReview.

A systematic literature review seeks to comprehensively identify and synthesize all studies conducted on a given topic. However, how does one ensure that the entire state of the art on a given topic has been covered? How does one collect and select a large number of publications on a given topic, and how does one analyze the knowledge extracted from these publications? In other words, how do we use systematic literature analysis to produce new knowledge from existing knowledge?

In the paper, we provide illustrations, examples, and detailed information on the various alternatives for conducting systematic reviews, presenting a review of available sources and tools. We report an analysis of the articles published in the journal International Transactions in Operational Research to show the potential and limitations of systematic review versus domain expert‐based selection.

Active learning techniques can improve the efficiency of screening and prioritize the most likely relevant studies. The performance of these techniques can only be evaluated using fully labeled datasets, which are not always available. The main goal of the current paper was to create such adataset by reconstructing a fully labeled dataset based on the search queries, number of results foreach query, list of included papers, and number of initially screened articles. A systematic review of the treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder, correctly following the PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews, was our case study. The reconstructed dataset (k=1053) did not exactly match the initial dataset (k=1013), due to mismatching in the closed-source search tools, retracted papers, and other reasons outside the influence of the original authors. Consequently, although the reconstructed dataset contained all initially relevant records, we could not simply label all otherrecords as irrelevant; within the label noise, additional relevant records could be present. Therefore, we developed a noisy label filter (NLF) procedure to deal with unknown labels. After applying the NLFprocedure, we used the reconstructed dataset for a simulation study using the open-source softwareASReview.

Here, we aim to fill this gap by examining the existing sports and physical activity literature, especially focusing on how the value-generating functions have been addressed in previous research. To ensure comprehensive coverage, a machine-learning approach (ASReview) was employed for efficient paper screening, resulting in a total of N = 20 relevant articles from an initial pool of 28,079 identified articles. Several of these articles provided evidence that physical effort can be inherently rewarding and add value to an outcome. Moreover, several research focal points could be identified: the generalization of effort's value across domains, developmental aspects, neural correlates of effort valuation, and different measurement approaches used to assess the value of physical effort. There is still a dearth of research investigating the value of physical effort in sports and exercise.

Communication helps providers bond with patients, forming therapeutic relationships that benefit patient-centred outcomes. The information exchanged between the provider and patient can help in medical decision-making, such as better self-management. This rapid review investigated the effects of quality and effective communication on patient-centred outcomes among older patients.                                            Methods                Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched using keywords like “effective communication,“ “elderly,“ and “well-being.“ Studies published between 2000 and 2023 describing or investigating communication strategies between older patients (65 years and above) and providers in various healthcare settings were considered for selection. The quality of selected studies was assessed using the GRADE Tool.                                            Results                The search strategy yielded seven studies. Five studies were qualitative (two phenomenological study, one ethnography, and two grounded theory studies), one was a cross-sectional observational study, and one was an experimental study. The studies investigated the effects of verbal and nonverbal communication strategies between patients and providers on various patient-centred outcomes, such as patient satisfaction, quality of care, quality of life, and physical and mental health. All the studies reported that various verbal and non-verbal communication strategies positively impacted all patient-centred outcomes.                                            Conclusion                Although the selected studies supported the positive impact of effective communication with older adults on patient-centred outcomes, they had various methodological setbacks that need to be bridged in the future. Future studies should utilize experimental approaches, generalizable samples, and specific effect size estimates.","2023-08-22","2024-02-27 12:49:35","2024-03-11 08:30:44","2024-02-27 12:49:35","886","","1","23","","BMC Health Serv Res","Quality communication can improve patient-centred health outcomes among older patients","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Researchers may heavily rely on a paper they cite, they may refute it entirely, or they may mention it only in passing, so an accurate classification of a citation is valuable for researchers and users. While AI solutions have emerged to provide a more nuanced meaning, the accuracy of these tools has yet to be determined. This project seeks to assess the accuracy of scite in assessing the meaning of citations in a sample of publications.  Methods: Using a previously established sample of systematic reviews that cited retracted publications, we conducted known item searching in scite, a tool that uses machine learning to categorize the meaning of citations. scite's interpretation of the citation's meaning was recorded,  as was our assessment of the citation’s meaning. Citations were classified as mentioning, supporting or contrasting. Recall, precision, and f-measure were calculated to describe the accuracy of scite's assessment in comparison to human assessment.  Results: From the original sample of 324 citations, 98 citations were classified in scite. Of these, scite found that 2 were supporting and 96 were mentioning, while we determined that 42 were supporting, 39 were mentioning, and 17 were contrasting. Supporting citations had high precision and low recall, while mentioning citations had high recall and low precision. F-measures ranged between 0.0 and 0.58, representing low classification accuracy.  Conclusions: In our sample, the overall accuracy of scite's assessments was low. scite was less able to classify supporting and contrasting citations, and instead labeled them as mentioning. Although there is potential and enthusiasm for AI to make engagement with literature easier and more immediate, the results generated from AI differed significantly from the human interpretation.","2023-09-13","2024-02-27 13:02:53","2024-03-11 08:30:40","2024-02-27 13:02:52","","","2","35","","Hypothesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The constant increase in the volume of publications requires the automation of this tedious task, in order to find and extract relevant articles from the pack. This task is critical, as serious Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) still account for a large number of hospital admissions each year. The aim of this study is to develop an augmented intelligence methodology for automatically identifying relevant publications mentioning an established link between a Drug and a Serious Adverse Event, according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) definition of seriousness. The proposed pipeline, called LiSA (for Literature Search Application), is based on three independent deep learning models supporting a precise detection of safety signals in the biomedical literature. By combining a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithms and a modular architecture, the pipeline achieves a precision of 0.81 and a recall of 0.89 at sentences level in articles extracted from PubMed (either abstract or full-text). We also measured that by using LiSA, a medical reviewer increases by a factor of 2.5 the number of relevant documents it can collect and evaluate compared to a simple keyword search. In the interest of re-usability, emphasis was placed on building a modular pipeline allowing the insertion of other NLP modules to enrich the results provided by the system, and extend it to other use cases. In addition, a lightweight visualization tool was developed to analyze and monitor safety signal results. Overall, the generic pipeline and the visualization tool proposed in this article allows for efficient and accurate monitoring of serious adverse drug reactions from the literature and can easily be adapted to similar pharmacovigilance use cases. To facilitate reproducibility and benefit other research studies, we also shared a first benchmark dataset for Serious Adverse Drug Events detection.","2023-03-30","2022-07-05 10:29:33","2024-09-05 21:17:42","2022-07-05 10:29:33","","","","","","","LiSA","","","","","","","en","","","","","tel.archives-ouvertes.fr","","","","","","non-peer_reviewed_article","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systematic reviews of existing literature can help fill this gap; however, well-done systematic reviews are time-demanding and labor-intensive. Here, we propose an automatic document classification approach to a systematic review to significantly reduce the effort in reviewing documents and optimizing empiric decision making. We first describe a manual document classification procedure that is used to curate a pertinent training dataset and then propose three classifiers: a keyword-guided method, a cluster analysis-based method, and a random forest approach that utilizes a large set of feature tokens. This approach is used to identify documents studying female sex workers that contain content relevant to either HIV or experienced violence. We compare the performance of the three classifiers by cross-validation in terms of area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic and precision and recall plot, and found random forest approach reduces the amount of manual reading for our example by 80%; in sensitivity analysis, we found that even trained with only 10% of data, the classifier can still avoid reading 75% of future documents (68% of total) while retaining 80% of relevant documents. In sum, the automated procedure of document classification presented here could improve both the precision and efficiency of systematic reviews and facilitate live reviews, where reviews are updated regularly. We expect to obtain a reasonable classifier by taking 20% of retrieved documents as training samples. The proposed classifier could also be used for more meaningfully assembling literature in other research areas and for rapid documents screening with a tight schedule, such as COVID-related work during the crisis.","2022-06-30","2022-07-06 12:12:23","2024-09-05 21:15:06","2022-07-06 12:12:23","e0270034","","6","17","","PLOS ONE","Automating document classification with distant supervision to increase the efficiency of systematic reviews","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","","","","peer_reviewed_article; SR_methodology","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Predicting hospital admission in this patient group could enable timely intervention, with subsequent reduction of these admissions. To date, hospital admission prediction remains challenging. Increasing amounts of acquired data and development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology allow for the creation of reliable hospital prediction algorithms for HF patients.This scoping review describes the current literature on strategies and performance of AI-based algorithms for prediction of hospital admission in patients with HF.PubMed, EMBASE and the Web of Science were used to search for articles using machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods to predict hospitalization in patients with HF.After eligibility screening, 23 articles were included. Sixteen articles predicted 30-day hospital (re-)admission resulting in an AUC ranging from 0.61 to 0.79. Six studies predicted hospital admission over longer time periods ranging from six months to three years, with AUC’s ranging from 0.65 to 0.78. One study prospectively evaluated performance of a disposable sensory patch at home after hospitalization which resulted in an AUC of 0.89 for unplanned hospital admission prediction.AI has the potential to enable prediction of hospital admission in HF patients. Improvement of data management, adding new data sources such as telemonitoring data and ML models and prospective and external validation of current models must be performed before clinical applicability is possible.","2022-06-24","2022-07-06 12:00:56","2023-12-01 14:50:26","2022-07-06 12:00:56","ztac035","","","","","European Heart Journal - Digital Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","","","multiple_screeners; peer_reviewed_article; systematic_review; stopping_rule","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are quite unpractical in their usage and are quickly outdated. Nevertheless, SLRs can bring a lot of quality output in providing an overview of newly established field or in synthesising main approaches to guide foundational research in already established fields. This thesis utilises the method of a literature review to aggregate approaches and tools that can aid in the automation of systematic literature reviews. Six dimensions have been compiled in order for the organisation of the presentation of extracted data from the research articles, which are procedural aspects, search process, screening process, selection process, data-extraction process and collaborative aspects. Problems, causes and solutions are being discussed and elaborated on. Ultimately, the thesis elicits the discrepancy between the current and the desired situation and synthesises the approaches to provide suggestions for further research in automation approaches. The goal is to ask the question of how would the research community and beyond benefit, if the power of SLR could be harnessed at low cost and with high accessibility? The thesis addresses this question by attending to the role and usage of technologies in the field of systematic literature reviews.","2022-07-01","2022-08-10 11:20:25","2023-12-01 14:50:26","2022-08-10 11:20:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis","","","","","Publisher: University of Twente","","","","thesis","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, Virtual Reality (VR) technology might have the potential to address those limitations. Therefore, the database on this research area was explored by this scoping review to establish an overview of the current state of the art regarding the treatment and assessment of aggression and violence through VR in diverse populations. In total, 15 studies were incorporated in this review after a comprehensive exploration. Those studies were analysed regarding several study characteristics, the usability/feasibility, and the effectiveness of VR in treating and assessing aggression. Promising results were discovered regarding the treatment and assessment of aggression through VR in diverse populations. Studies mostly identified VR as an effective intervention for positively influencing proximal and distal determinants of aggression and as a valid assessment instrument for aggression. Treatment results are mostly in line with a previous comprehensive review from 2019. The amount of newly discovered studies from the last three years indicates that research around aggression treatment through VR seems to have risen and that research around aggression assessment through VR seems to have started. Since research around VR aggression assessment is new, further research advancements are needed.","2022-08-23","2022-09-17 11:45:38","2023-12-01 14:50:26","2022-09-17 11:45:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis","","","","","Publisher: University of Twente","","","","systematic_review; stopping_rule; thesis","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the key challenges for creating predictive maintenance systems is the lack of failure data, as the machine is frequently repaired before failure. Digital Twins provide a real-time representation of the physical machine and generate data, such as asset degradation, which the predictive maintenance algorithm can use. Since 2018, scientific literature on the utilization of Digital Twins for predictive maintenance has accelerated, indicating the need for a thorough review. Objective This research aims to gather and synthesize the studies that focus on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins to pave the way for further research. Method A systematic literature review (SLR) using an active learning tool is conducted on published primary studies on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, in which 42 primary studies have been analyzed. Results This SLR identifies several aspects of predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, including the objectives, application domains, Digital Twin platforms, Digital Twin representation types, approaches, abstraction levels, design patterns, communication protocols, twinning parameters, and challenges and solution directions. These results contribute to a Software Engineering approach for developing predictive maintenance using Digital Twins in academics and the industry. Conclusion This study is the first SLR in predictive maintenance using Digital Twins. We answer key questions for designing a successful predictive maintenance model leveraging Digital Twins. We found that to this day, computational burden, data variety, and complexity of models, assets, or components are the key challenges in designing these models.","2022-11-01","2022-08-10 11:52:13","2023-12-01 14:50:26","2022-08-10 11:52:13","107008","","","151","","Information and Software Technology","Predictive maintenance using digital twins","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","peer_reviewed_article; systematic_review; stopping_rule","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Choosing the proper feature extractor can greatly affect the performance of a classifier. Feature extraction has evolved from the older techniques such as tf-idf and Doc2Vec to transformers that have already been pre- trained on large corpora. However, although the newer techniques seem promising, it is not always clear when and why one feature extractor may outperform another. The aim of this study is to examine if state-of-the-art feature extractors (i.e., transformers like RoBERTa, MPNET, and SPECTER) can outperform classical feature extractors (i.e., tf-idf and Doc2Vec) when classifying systematic reviews as relevant or irrelevant. The study involved running multiple simulations with the ASReview software to see how well the different feature extractors (in combination with various classifiers) classified research articles as relevant or irrelevant. The results indicated that a tf-idf feature extractor, in combination with a Naive Bayes classifier, outperformed all other combinations, including the sentence transformer feature extractors.","2022","2022-09-17 12:14:16","2023-12-01 14:50:25","2022-09-17 12:14:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EN","CC-BY-NC-ND","","","","studenttheses.uu.nl","","Accepted: 2022-09-09T00:02:48Z","","","","thesis","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the improved data quality is that a solution recommender can be built, which recommends solutions to operators, meaning that the time it takes an operator to solve a problem will be decreased. This in turn reduces the impact of the incident, meaning that the action problem of having more impactful incidents than preferred is remediated through the core problem: The quality of data of the incident registration process is insufficient to optimise AI recovery of incidents. This lack of data quality is expressed in two manners. First, measurements show that field ‘solution’ is too often filled in with a non-English language, or not filled in at all. Second, the user ratings required for a recommender system cannot be collected. The goal of this study is to find a way to collect the required user ratings from Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps) using teams and to find a way to improve the quality of data filled in by all teams.

The performances of two machine learning models, SVM and Logistic regression, are compared. The dataset used is a labelled dataset on weak signal literature. The data is iteratively split into training and testing sets with the aim of minimising the training set. The models were evaluated on Sensitivity (Recall), Precision, Specificity, Accuracy, and f1_Score to find the optimal training split. The optimal value was found to be between 40% to 50%. Which meant only 40% to 50% of the dataset needed to be labelled for the machine learning model to predict the labels for the rest of the dataset.

Textuelle Daten entstehen in verschiedensten Bereichen: Sei es in Konversationen, in Schichtbüchern oder in Wartungsdokumenten – eine automatisierte Verarbeitung, Strukturierung und Wissensextraktion ermöglicht Lösungen, die automatisiert neues Prozesswissen zu Tage bringen. Derartige Ansätze können in verschiedensten Branchen von Vorteil sein – sei es in der Biomedizin, wenn Patientenakten, Vorerkrankungen und Behandlungen mit tausenden anderen Patienten verglichen und so personalisierte, vielversprechendere Behandlungen durchgeführt werden können, im Bereich der Produktion, wenn Fehlerraten mithilfe datengetriebener Wartung reduziert werden können, oder im Bereich der Business Intelligence, wenn Firmenübernahmen mithilfe eines Vergleichs mit historischen Ereignissen vorhergesagt werden können. Zusammen mit Methoden aus dem Bereich der Lernprozessanalyse können Organisationen weiters den Lernfortschritt sowie die künftige Entwicklung von Mitarbeitern, die an Prozessen beteiligt sind, abschätzen und dadurch auf eine bessere Datenbasis für die Planung zukünftiger Rekrutierungs- und Weiterbildungsmaßnahmen zurückgreifen. Prozesse, welche in unstrukturierter Form aufgezeichnet werden und die von menschlichen Akteuren abhängig sind, stellen konventionelle Process Mining Lösungen vor eine schwierige Aufgabe. Derartige Ansätze benötigen meist wohlstrukturierte und vorgefilterte Eingaben. Um dies zu erreichen, müssen strukturierte Informationen aus den Eingangsdaten mittels Methoden des Text Minings extrahiert werden. Da dies häufig modellbasiert und mit Methoden des überwachten Lernens geschieht, ist dafür in der Regel ein entsprechendes Training der Modelle nötig. Dies steht dem Ziel der Entwicklung einer domänenunabhängigen Lösung entgegen. Schließlich benötigen viele Methoden der Lernprozessanalyse sinnvolle Ergebnisse der vorgeschalteten Process Mining Komponente, um Metriken zu berechnen und optimale Prozessabläufe zu finden, welche als Vergleich für alle anderen Prozessdurchläufe dienen. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist die Extraktion von Informationen über Prozessabläufe aus unstrukturierten Textdokumenten. Dafür werden Methoden aus den genannten Feldern kombiniert und ein Modell einer integrierten Datenpipeline entwickelt. Ein Proof-Of-Concept Demonstrator des entwickelten Modells wird in Python implementiert und anhand eines Musterdatensatzes, welcher Kommunikationsdaten eines Bewerbungsprozesses aus der Human Resource Perspektive beinhaltet, validiert. Weitergehende Forschung könnte anhand von Datenstreams eine Echtzeitanalyse sowie -überwachung der gesammelten Daten und Prozesse ermöglichen. Weiters könnten größere Datensätze mit ausbalancierteren Attributen bessere und aussagekräftigere Lernkurven liefern. Schließlich könnte eine Kombination aus der in dieser Arbeit präsentierten Datenpipeline mit domänenspezifischen Ontologien eine automatische Benennung der gefundenen Aktivitäten-Cluster ermöglichen und die Genauigkeit weiter erhöhen.","2022","2022-11-14 15:35:05","2023-12-01 14:50:21","2022-11-14 15:35:05","","","","","","","","","","","","Wien","","en","","Thesis","","","repositum.tuwien.at","","Accepted: 2022-08-03T09:33:10Z Journal Abbreviation: Prozessmodell zur Optimierung des Menschlichen Lernens in Geschäftsprozessen anhand Unstrukturierter Daten DOI: 10.34726/hss.2022.97304","","","","uitzoeken; thesis","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forcibly displaced children and youth have often been exposed to stressful life events and are therefore at increased risk of developing mental health issues. Hence, early screening and assessment for mental health problems is of great importance, as is research addressing this topic. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the reliability and validity of mental health assessment tools for this population.Objective: The aim of the present study was to synthesise the existing evidence on psychometric properties of patient reported outcome measures [PROMs] for assessing the mental health of asylum-seeking, refugee and internally displaced children and youth.Method: Systematic searches of the literature were conducted in four electronic databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Web of Science. The methodological quality of the studies was examined using the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist. Furthermore, the COSMIN criteria for good measurement properties were used to evaluate the quality of the outcome measures.Results: The search yielded 4842 articles, of which 27 met eligibility criteria. The reliability, internal consistency, structural validity, hypotheses testing and criterion validity of 28 PROMs were evaluated.Conclusion: Based on the results with regard to validity and reliability, as well as feasibility, we recommend the use of several instruments to measure emotional and behavioural problems, PTSD symptoms, anxiety and depression in forcibly displaced children and youth. However, despite a call for more research on the psychometric properties of mental health assessment tools for forcibly displaced children and youth, there is still a lack of studies conducted on this topic. More research is needed in order to establish cross-cultural validity of mental health assessment tools and to provide optimal cut-off scores for this population.HIGHLIGHTSResearch on the psychometric properties of mental health screening and assessment tools for forcibly displaced children and youth is slowly increasing.However, based on the current evidence on the validity and reliability of screening and assessment tools for forcibly displaced children, we are not able to recommend a core set of instruments. Instead, we provide suggestions for best practice.More research of sufficient quality is important in order to establish crsoss-cultural validity and to provide optimal cut-off scores in mental health screening and assessment tools for different populations of forcibly displaced children and youth.","2022-12-19","2022-11-14 15:26:35","2023-12-01 14:50:21","2022-11-14 15:26:35","2126468","","2","13","","","Mental health screening and assessment tools for forcibly displaced children","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2022.2126468","","","","peer_reviewed_article; systematic_review; stopping_rule","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such a learning cycle, a machine learning model suggests the next abstract to be reviewed, and a researcher classifies the abstract as relevant or irrelevant. A systematic review should include all relevant studies, regardless of the language it is conducted in. Machine translation of abstracts helps here, but it is unknown how classification performance changes when abstracts are translated. This study simulates the active learning process with English datasets, and with the same datasets that were machine-translated to German, Spanish and Turkish. A key step in the active learning pipeline is the generation of a vector representation of the text, using a feature extractor. The feature extraction methods tf-idf, Doc2Vec, FastText and SBERT were compared on their classification performance for all languages. The results show that no consistent disadvantage to translation can be found for the selected datasets, except for FastText.","2022","2022-09-17 12:27:10","2023-12-01 14:50:19","2022-09-17 12:27:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EN","CC-BY-NC-ND","","","","studenttheses.uu.nl","","Accepted: 2022-09-09T04:01:45Z","","","","thesis","/unread; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using the PRISMA-protocol, we analyse evidence of the claim that co-creation enhances services, relationships between citizens and governments, and the democratic quality of governance. Analysing 71 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters, we find that democratic quality effects are studied most. Empirical studies find that public values are mostly positively impacted through co-creation, while theoretical contributions are more sceptical about co-creation outcomes.

Screening titles and abstracts (T&Ab) for inclusion in a systematic review is an intensive, and often collaborative, step. The use of appropriate tools is therefore important. In this study, we identified and evaluated the usability of software tools that support T&Ab screening for systematic reviews within healthcare research.                                            Methods                We identified software tools using three search methods: a web-based search; a search of the online “systematic review toolbox”; and screening of references in existing literature. We included tools that were accessible and available for testing at the time of the study (December 2018), do not require specific computing infrastructure and provide basic screening functionality for systematic reviews. Key properties of each software tool were identified using a feature analysis adapted for this purpose. This analysis included a weighting developed by a group of medical researchers, therefore prioritising the most relevant features. The highest scoring tools from the feature analysis were then included in a user survey, in which we further investigated the suitability of the tools for supporting T&Ab screening amongst systematic reviewers working in medical research.                                            Results                                  Fifteen tools met our inclusion criteria. They vary significantly in relation to cost, scope and intended user community. Six of the identified tools (Abstrackr, Colandr, Covidence, DRAGON, EPPI-Reviewer and Rayyan) scored higher than 75% in the feature analysis and were included in the user survey. Of these, Covidence and Rayyan were the most popular with the survey respondents. Their usability scored highly across a range of metrics, with all surveyed researchers (                  n                   = 6) stating that they would be likely (or very likely) to use these tools in the future.                                                            Conclusions                Based on this study, we would recommend Covidence and Rayyan to systematic reviewers looking for suitable and easy to use tools to support T&Ab screening within healthcare research. These two tools consistently demonstrated good alignment with user requirements. We acknowledge, however, the role of some of the other tools we considered in providing more specialist features that may be of great importance to many researchers.","2020-12","2023-01-11 09:21:17","2024-09-05 21:09:16","2023-01-11 09:21:16","7","","1","20","","BMC Med Res Methodol","Software tools to support title and abstract screening for systematic reviews in healthcare","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","peer_reviewed_article","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whether that might ever be possible would depend on how we define intelligence, but what is indisputable is that new methods are needed to analyse and interpret the copious information provided by digital medical images, genomic databases, and biobanks. Technological advances have enabled applications of artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning (ML) to be implemented into clinical practice, and their related scientific literature is exploding. Advocates argue enthusiastically that AI will transform many aspects of clinical cardiovascular medicine, while sceptics stress the importance of caution and the need for more evidence. This report summarizes the main opposing arguments that were presented in a debate at the 2021 Congress of the European Society of Cardiology. Artificial intelligence is an advanced analytical technique that should be considered when conventional statistical methods are insufficient, but testing a hypothesis or solving a clinical problem—not finding another application for AI—remains the most important objective. Artificial intelligence and ML methods should be transparent and interpretable, if they are to be approved by regulators and trusted to provide support for clinical decisions. Physicians need to understand AI methods and collaborate with engineers. Few applications have yet been shown to have a positive impact on clinical outcomes, so investment in research is essential.","2021-12-01","2022-02-15 16:03:56","2024-09-05 21:10:39","2022-02-15","721-726","","4","2","","European Heart Journal - Digital Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","peer_reviewed_article; other","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the Waste Framework Directive and the Circular Economy Action Plan, they share the common goal of increasing recycling. The first step towards increasing the recycling of valuable materials (e.g. glass, plastic, metal, paper) is to implement a successful separate waste collection (SWC) system. Citizens’ behaviour plays a key role in separate collection. Thus, it is important to understand the main behavioural factors of waste sorting and how they can be encouraged. This study presents the main findings of a literature review focused on identifying and classifying the factors underlying SWC. Along with the literature review, various stakeholders participated in a survey to identify the factors influencing SWC. We discuss factors affecting whether people are motivated, capable and perceive the right opportunities to sort their waste. These factors allow for a much more detailed understanding of consumer waste sorting than socio-demographic characteristics. However, some factors might be more or less relevant depending on the countries and municipalities in which waste sorting takes place. Usually, waste management companies/organisations and local authorities in charge of waste management propose interventions that aim to either motivate people to sort waste, to provide them with the necessary abilities, or to create opportunities to sort waste. These interventions do so by affecting, either explicitly or implicitly, one or several factors influencing waste sorting behaviour. Thus, this report aims at understanding how interventions affect citizens’ sorting behaviour. Results show that a single type of policy intervention alone might not be able to achieve good results in terms of engaging citizens to increase SWC. Therefore, a combination of policy interventions (regulations, economic incentives and communication) is likely needed to get citizens to sort their waste correctly. A more detailed analysis is presented for four possible policy interventions, namely, collection schemes, harmonised pictograms, information systems, and economic instruments, in order to determine best practices for citizen engagement.","2022","2023-01-05 13:18:14","2023-12-01 14:50:00","2023-01-05 13:18:14","","","","","","","Separate collection of municipal waste","","","","","Publications Office of the European Union","LU","eng","","","","","Publications Office of the European Union","KJ-NA-31-310-EN-N","","","","","non-peer_reviewed_article","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These platforms accelerate the development of applications by letting devel- opers build models in a higher abstraction. They also provide deployment and life-cycle management functionality. As these platforms evolve, problems can arise. For exam- ple, when metamodels and models do not conform to each other, the built software will malfunction, and users of the application might not have the desired interactions. Therefore the right decisions need to be taken. Change Impact Analysis (CIA) can be done in order to assist developers of these platforms to support the evolution of the platform. There is not much known about CIA in the context of LCDPs. There- fore we conduct a literature review on the currently available approaches. We found that almost no publications mention CIA in an LCDP context. There are however various papers that present interesting directions for CIA within Model-Driven Engi- neering which could be applied within LCDPs. Some of these techniques can be used for general-purpose modeling languages such as UML, but some are only applicable to domain-specific languages. These approaches generally made use of techniques such as explicit rules and traceability in order to analyze changes. There are also several other techniques that are more suitable for more advanced approaches. Recommendations are given about how an LCDP supplier should build up their CIA for their platform. With this knowledge, several directions are presented which researchers can explore to improve this domain. Some of these gather more grounding of the current approaches, provide users with improved feedback, or make their approach more correct and com- plete. At last, recommendations are given to bring the found approaches closer to the LCDP domain by suggesting case studies with other LCDPs","2022","2023-01-05 13:15:49","2023-12-01 14:50:00","2023-01-05 13:15:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EN","CC-BY-NC-ND","Master Thesis","","","studenttheses.uu.nl","","Accepted: 2022-12-14T01:00:55Z","","","","thesis; mention_only","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ze hebben immers vaak niet zelf gekozen voor hulpverlening en hebben vaker ook eerdere negatieve behandelervaringen. Behandelmotivatie is echter wel van belang voor het behalen van positieve behandelresultaten. Deze literatuurstudie vond onder andere dat behandelmotivatie in belangrijke mate wordt bepaald door factoren in de omgeving en dat hulpverleners een belangrijke rol kunnen spelen in het vergroten ervan. Een grote behandelmotivatie voorspelt zowel deelname aan behandeling, als het voltooien ervan. Terwijl een lage behandelmotivatie geassocieerd is met uitval en recidive. Om meer zicht te krijgen op de te beïnvloeden factoren die samenhangen met behandelmotivatie bij jongeren in de forensische jeugdzorg is er een systematische literatuurstudie uitgevoerd. Om ook de praktijk bij de studie te betrekken zijn er tevens twee bijeenkomsten geweest met een expertgroep van jongeren die zelf met forensische jeugdzorg te maken hebben (gehad) en een digitale expertsessie met professionals uit de praktijk. In de literatuurstudie zijn 23 wetenschappelijke artikelen geïncludeerd en is er gekeken welke factoren samenhangen met behandelmotivatie. De resultaten indiceren met name bewijs voor het belang van verbondenheid (werkrelatie met hulpverlener) en ervaren autonomie. Daarnaast bleken kenmerken van de behandeling, de behandelomgeving en de behandelaren een rol te spelen. Ook het type en de ernst van de problematiek van een jongere, en met name de mate waarin die daar zelf last van heeft, hangt samen met de behandelmotivatie. Tijdens de bijeenkomsten met de jongeren werd er dieper ingegaan op de bevindingen uit de literatuurstudie en werden de aanbevelingen geconcretiseerd. De belangrijkste aspecten voor behandelmotivatie zijn volgens de jongeren het hebben van een goede relatie met de hulpverlener, mogen meebeslissen over de behandeling en het gevoel hebben dat er naar je geluisterd wordt. In de expertsessie met praktijkprofessionals hebben werd er tot slot gesproken over het belang van toekomstperspectief bieden door de hulpverlening aan jongeren en de rol van ouder(s)/verzorger(s) bij de behandeling. Op basis van de resultaten van de literatuurstudie en de input van jongeren en praktijkprofessionals zijn er aanbevelingen geformuleerd voor het vergroten van de behandelmotivatie van jongeren in de forensische jeugdzorg. Hieronder vallen bijvoorbeeld het faciliteren en opbouwen van een vertrouwensband met jongeren, jongeren een stem geven in hun behandeling, en het bieden van mogelijkheden en toekomstperspectief.

If we could predict individual outcome and identify predictors of outcome, we could personalize and optimize treatment and care. Recent research showed that recovery rates tend to stabilize early in the course of disease. Short- to medium- term treatment goals are most relevant for clinical practice. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify predictors of outcome ≤1 year in prospective studies of patients with SSD. For our meta-analysis risk of bias was assessed with the QUIPS tool. Results 178 studies were included for analysis. Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the chance of symptomatic remission was lower in males, and in patients with longer duration of untreated psychosis, more symptoms, worse global functioning, more previous hospital admissions and worse treatment adherence. The chance of readmission was higher for patients with more previous admissions. The chance of functional improvement was lower in patients with worse functioning at baseline. For other proposed predictors of outcome, like age at onset and depressive symptoms, limited to no evidence was found. Discussion This study illuminates predictors of outcome of SSD. Level of functioning at baseline was the best predictor of all investigated outcomes. Furthermore, we found no evidence for many predictors proposed in original research. Possible reasons for this include the lack of prospective research, between-study heterogeneity and incomplete reporting. We therefore recommend open access to datasets and analysis scripts, enabling other researchers to reanalyze and pool the data.","2023-04-01","2023-04-17 09:30:10","2023-12-01 14:49:58","2023-04-17 09:30:10","133-142","","","254","","Schizophrenia Research","Systematic review and meta-analysis on predictors of prognosis in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","peer_reviewed_article; systematic_review; stopping_rule","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using feature toggles is a technique that allows developers to either include or exclude a block of code with a variable in a conditional statement. Software companies increasingly use feature toggles to facilitate continuous integration and continuous delivery. On the other hand, configuration options are programmatic techniques to include or exclude functionality in software easily. Software companies usually use configuration options to implement software product lines. Feature toggles and configuration options have similar definitions, and the border between their definitions is blurred. So, both concepts are considered software configuration in the literature. Using feature toggles inappropriately may cause problems that can have a severe impact, such as code complexity, dead code, and system failure. For example, the erroneous repurposing of an old feature toggle caused Knight Capital Group, an American global financial services firm, to go bankrupt due to the implications of the resultant incorrect system behavior. Using configuration options also has challenges, such as testing multiple software variants in parallel. For example, the Linux kernel has over 15000 configuration options, and (considering all configuration options as boolean) it has up to 215000 product variants for testing. The research contributions on feature toggles and configuration options often focused on either feature toggles or configuration options. However, focusing on the similarities and differences between these two techniques can enable a more fruitful combined family of research.Moreover, a common terminology may enable meta-analysis, a more practical application of the research on feature toggles and configuration options, and prevent duplication of research effort. Using a comprehensive model of software configuration can help researchers in a combined family of research on the software configuration. We conduct four studies to (1) identify practices of using feature toggles by practitioners; (2) propose heuristics and metrics for structuring feature toggles in the code; (3) extend an existing model of software configuration to cover feature toggle and enable meta-analysis of a family of research; (4) application of the extended model of software configuration on related publications, performa meta-analysis, and propose guidelines for researchers to document context variables in their software configuration research studies. From these studies, we contribute the following: (1) 17 practices of using feature toggles by practitioners in 4 categories; (2) 7 heuristics to guide structuring feature toggles in the source code, and 12 metrics to support the principles embodied in these heuristics; (3) an extended model of software configuration to cover feature toggle concept as well as configuration option concept; (4) a comparison between feature toggle and configuration option related publications based on the application of the extended model of software configuration; (5) provide guidelines for researchers to use the extended model of software configuration to document context variables in their research studies; and (6) comprehensive definitions for feature toggles and configuration options based on their different characteristics in the application of the extended model of software configuration.","2022-12-06","2023-04-17 08:14:51","2025-02-26 15:59:24","2023-04-17","","","","","","","","","","","","North Carolina State University","","","","","","","","","","","","","systematic_review","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ambition of this study is twofold: first, to present more clarity regarding the definition of the concept. Second, to develop a framework that explains the antecedents, characteristics and outcomes of relational quality in PPPs. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review of 99 academic articles, which were analyzed and coded on the definition, characteristics, antecedents and outcomes of relational quality. Findings The study shows that trust, communication, commitment, openness and reciprocity are considered core aspects of the concept. The analysis further identifies important antecedents (e.g. shared values, leadership) and outcomes (performance, innovation) of relational quality in PPPs. The findings result in the development of a framework on relational quality in PPPs to be used for further research. Research limitations/implications The findings indicate that relational quality is valuable for the functioning of PPPs, but the current focus of this review excludes studies addressing relational quality in other types of collaboration and public–private exchange. The lessons from these research fields might further improve people’s understanding of relational quality. Practical implications Practitioners should pay attention to relational quality in long-term PPPs. Among others, (process) management activities might contribute to relational quality as it stimulates communication and openness. Originality/value The presented framework explaining antecedents, characteristics and outcomes of relational quality allows for more structured use of this concept in future research.","2023","2023-04-24 11:46:21","2023-12-01 14:49:58","2023-04-24 11:46:21","171-189","","2","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Seroprevalence studies measure the population prevalence of antibodies, providing key insight into these quantities. However, the results from these studies are dispersed, hindering their use. We developed SeroTracker, a dashboard and data platform for SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies. Through its ongoing systematic review, SeroTracker identified over 3,800 seroprevalence studies and made their data available to global health, government, and academic stakeholders. Meta-analysing these studies, we show that global SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was 59.2% in September 2021 (95% confidence interval 56.1 − 62.2%), and rose steeply during 2021 due to infection in some regions and vaccination in others. We also identify limitations of seroprevalence studies: their timeliness, where the median study is published 154 days after being conducted; measurement bias, where assay manufacturers systematically overestimate sensitivity by 5.4% and specificity by 2.8%; and coverage, where seroprevalence studies are sparse in time and space. To address these challenges, we develop a Bayesian modelling framework that synthesises information from case and seroprevalence data to provide up- to-date estimates of true infections. We validate this model on simulated data and apply it to Canadian data, showing that only approximately 20% of infections were detected as cases at the start of the pandemic, and revealing substantial geographical heterogeneity in infection dynamics. Returning to SeroTracker’s evidence synthesis process, we develop an automated tool for risk of bias assessment with excellent reliability compared to manual review (intraclass correlation 0.77), and implement a natural language processing-based process to screen abstracts for our systematic review that reduces screening time by approximately 70%. Finally, we reflect on the increased risk posed by pandemics and discuss future work applying engineering to public health to reduce these risks, including the development of a central data repository for respiratory virus surveillance data.","2022","2023-04-17 10:01:46","2023-12-01 14:49:58","2023-04-17 10:01:46","","","","","","","SeroTracker","","","","","University of Oxford","","English","","http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text","","","ora.ox.ac.uk","","","","","","thesis; mention_only","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the perinatal period, women have expressed a preference for support delivered on the web. In this regard, interventions such as behavioral activation (BA), which are brief and structured psychosocial interventions, seem particularly suited to be delivered through digital solutions. Objective: This study aimed to map the literature investigating digital BA interventions deployed during the perinatal period. We paid particular attention to the methodological underpinnings of the studies, the potential impact of BA interventions on symptoms other than depression, and the existence of differences occurring when these interventions were administered during pregnancy versus the postpartum period. Methods: A systematic search compliant with the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines was conducted considering 5 bibliographic databases; reference lists and key journals were also screened by 2 independent authors following a double-blind approach. Results: A total of 7 studies published between 2013 and 2022 were included. In total, 2 studies were protocols for randomized controlled trials, 5 were empirical studies, and 1 was a qualitative study. All studies focused on the postpartum period, except for 1 that focused on the broader perinatal period. Promising effects on depression symptoms were reported but not on other psychosocial symptoms. Low intervention adherence has emerged, whereas the usability associated with the digital means used to deploy interventions was scarcely addressed; moreover, information on the digital platforms used was poorly reported overall. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the scarcity and preliminary nature of digital BA interventions deployed during the perinatal period, where the focus seems more on treatment rather than prevention.

The primary objective of this study is to map the current state of the art and to identify open questions concerning data structuring, integration, and modeling and design of multi-scale objects and systems in architecture. Focus is placed on types of voxel models that are linked with computer-aided design models. This study utilizes a semi-systematic literature review methodology that combines scoping and narrative methodology to examine different types and uses of voxel models. This is done across a range of disciplines, including architecture, spatial planning, computer vision, geomatics, geosciences, manufacturing, and mechanical and civil engineering. Voxel-model applications can be found in studies addressing generative design, geomatics, material science and computational morphogenesis. A targeted convergence of these approaches can lead to integrative, holistic, data-driven design approaches. We present (1) a summary and systematization of the research results reported in the literature in a novel manner, (2) the identification of research gaps concerning voxel-based data structures for multi-domain and trans-scalar data integration in architectural design and urban planning, and (3) any further research questions.","2023-06","2023-04-24 12:13:28","2024-09-05 21:15:58","2023-04-24 12:13:28","137-174","","2","3","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 2 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","","","peer_reviewed_article; systematic_review; mention_only","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the learning, social, and personal outcomes of gifted students in inclusive school settings. Twenty-five studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Regarding social and psychological outcomes, the results are mixed: gifted students experience positive relationships with their peers in the inclusive context, however, it appears that teaching inadequacy may lead to frustration and disengagement. Regarding learning outcomes, results on the difference between inclusive and segregated contexts are inconsistent and mostly non-statistically significant.

However, educational data ethics is an important factor that hinders the application of educational data. Thus, it is important to ensure privacy and security by reasonable use of educational data. As such, this research focuses on analysis of hot-points, trends in development and problems of educational data ethics in existing research using bibliometric analysis. Based on in-depth analysis, this study proposes targeted problem-solving strategies, and future developmental direction for learner-centered educational data ethics in the era of intelligent education. This study found three major problems in the educational data ethics: (a) violation of privacy during data collection, storage, and sharing, (b) the deprivation of the ability of educational subjects to make independent choices by prediction of educational data, (c) and the lack of “forgetting ability” based on data as the evaluation standard, which is one of the restrictions on the development of educational subjects. This research proposes that the corresponding problem-solving strategy in China should be learner-centered, combined with technologies such as blockchain, 5 G technology, and federated learning to form targeted solutions from different levels. Firstly, it is necessary to establish a standard system and related platforms of educational data from the macro level. Second, the research-practice dual channels should make efforts to build a new ecology of educational data. Third, schools and teachers must appropriately apply educational data in evaluation. Finally, this study provides direction and guidance for other countries or regions in researching educational data ethics.","2023-04-01","2023-04-24 12:25:19","2023-12-01 14:49:57","2023-04-24 12:25:19","1-14","","1","10","","Humanit Soc Sci Commun","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.library.uu.nl","","Number: 1 Publisher: Palgrave","","","","peer_reviewed_article; systematic_review; stopping_rule","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Smartphone use can affect patient quality of care and clinical outcomes. Objective: This scoping review aimed to describe how physicians use smartphones and mobile apps in clinical settings. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and reported the results according to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. We used the following databases in our literature search: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and gray literature for studies published since 2010. An additional search was also performed by scanning the reference lists of included studies. A narrative synthesis approach was used. Results: A total of 10 studies, published between 2016 and 2021, were included in this review. Of these studies, 8 used surveys and 2 used surveys with focus group study designs to explore smartphone use, its adoption, experience of using it, and views on the use of smartphones among physicians. There were studies with only general practitioners (n=3), studies with only specialists (n=3), and studies with both general practitioners and specialists (n=4). Physicians use smartphones and mobile apps for communication (n=9), clinical decision-making (n=7), drug compendium (n=7), medical education and training (n=7), maintaining health records (n=4), managing time (n=4), and monitoring patients (n=2) in clinical practice. The Medscape medical app was frequently used for information gathering. WhatsApp, a nonmedical app, was commonly used for physician-patient communication. The commonly reported barriers were lack of regulatory oversight, privacy concerns, and limited Wi-Fi or internet access. The commonly reported facilitator was convenience and having access to evidence-based medicine, clinical decision-making support, and a wide array of apps. Conclusions: Smartphones and mobile apps were used for communication, medical education and training, clinical decision-making, and drug compendia in most studies. Although the benefits of smartphones and mobile apps for physicians at work were promising, there were concerns about patient privacy and confidentiality. Legislation is urgently needed to protect the liability of health care professionals using smartphones.","2023-03-31","2023-04-24 12:20:32","2023-12-01 14:49:57","2023-04-24 12:20:32","e44765","","1","11","","","Smartphone and Mobile App Use Among Physicians in Clinical Practice","","","","","","","EN","Unless stated otherwise, all articles are open-access distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work (""first published in JMIR mHealth and uHealth..."") is properly cited with original URL and bibliographic citation information.

A comprehensive database of published literature from multidisciplinary sources can address this fragmentation through the integration of diverse perspectives, identification and dissemination of best practices, and increase clarity about co-creation. However, two considerable challenges exist. First, there is uncertainty about co-creation terminology, making it difficult to identify relevant literature. Second, the exponential growth of scientific publications has led to an overwhelming amount of literature that surpasses the human capacity for a comprehensive review. These challenges hinder progress in co-creation research and underscore the need for a novel methodology to consolidate and investigate the literature. Objective: This study aimed to synthesize knowledge about co-creation across various fields through the development and application of an artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted selection process. The ultimate goal of this database was to provide stakeholders interested in co-creation with relevant literature. Methods: We created a novel methodology for establishing a curated database. To accommodate the variation in terminology, we used a broad definition of co-creation that encompassed the essence of existing definitions. To filter out irrelevant information, an AI-assisted selection process was used. In addition, we conducted bibliometric analyses and quality control procedures to assess content and accuracy. Overall, this approach allowed us to develop a robust and reliable database that serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders interested in co-creation. Results: The final version of the database included 13,501 papers, which are indexed in Zenodo and accessible in an open-access downloadable format. The quality assessment revealed that 20.3% (140/688) of the database likely contained irrelevant material, whereas the methodology captured 91% (58/64) of the relevant literature. Participatory and variations of the term co-creation were the most frequent terms in the title and abstracts of included literature. The predominant source journals included health sciences, sustainability, environmental sciences, medical research, and health services research. Conclusions: This study produced a high-quality, open-access database about co-creation. The study demonstrates that it is possible to perform a systematic review selection process on a fragmented concept using human-AI collaboration. Our unified concept of co-creation includes the co-approaches (co-creation, co-design, and co-production), forms of participatory research, and user involvement. Our analysis of authorship, citations, and source landscape highlights the potential lack of collaboration among co-creation researchers and underscores the need for future investigation into the different research methodologies.

Although machine learning and natural language processing algorithms may reduce this time and these resources, their performance has not been tested in the field of education and educational psychology, and there is a lack of clear information on when researchers should stop the reviewing process. In this study, we conducted a retrospective screening simulation using 27 systematic reviews in education and educational psychology. We evaluated the recall, work saved over sampling, and the estimated time savings of several active learning screening algorithms and heuristic stopping criteria. The results showed on average a 50% (SD = 20%) reduction in screening workload when using active learning algorithms for abstract screening and an estimated time savings of 1.64 days (SD = 1.78). The learning algorithm Random Forests with Sentence Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers outperformed other algorithms—a finding that emphasizes the importance of incorporating semantic and contextual information during feature extraction and modeling in the screening process. Furthermore, we found that 95% of all relevant abstracts within a given dataset can be retrieved using heuristic stopping rules. Specifically, an approach that stops the screening process after consecutively classifying 7% of irrelevant papers yielded the most significant gains in terms of works savings over sampling (M = 41%, SD = 26%). However, the performance of the heuristic stopping criteria depended on the active learning algorithm used, the length and the proportion of relevant papers in a database. Overall, our study provides empirical evidence on the performance of machine learning screening algorithms for abstract screening in systematic reviews in education and educational psychology.","2023-07-28","2023-08-01 11:43:01","2023-12-01 14:49:49","2023-08-01 11:43:01","","","","","","","Screening Smarter, Not Harder","","","","","PsyArXiv","","","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/fpwc2","","","","","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the increasing use of technology in mental health care, various e-health interventions promoting self-compassion have emerged. However, the full scope of the literature on their use for mental disorders was not assessed yet, which is therefore the aim of the current review. A comprehensive literature search was conducted, applying specific inclusion criteria: participants aged >18 with at least subclinical levels of a mental disorder, or moderate to high self-criticism or stress; interventions were digital and self-compassion based. Data of 15 studies was analyzed based on interventions, samples, outcomes and associated instruments, and intervention feasibility. Results showed that most participants were relatively young to middle-aged, predominantly female, suffering from disorders like depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia. Interventions were mostly offered as self-help programs, delivered via the Internet, and aimed to alleviate psychopathology. Outcomes were categorized as symptomatology, well-being, secondary outcomes, and treatment evaluation. Dropout and adherence rates yielded mixed results. While some individuals reported negative effects on symptoms and emotions, most expressed moderate satisfaction and acceptance of the interventions. Conclusively, it is recommended to investigate the efficacy of digitally enhancing self-compassion for various mental disorders.","2023-07-26","2023-08-21 13:22:03","2023-12-01 14:49:48","2023-08-21 13:22:02","","","","","","","E-Health interventions promoting self-compassion in mental disorders","","","","","","","en","","info:eu-repo/semantics/masterThesis","","","","","","","","","","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods                An electronic search of nine databases was completed from their inception until 1st September 2022.

This effect was not moderated by features of the samples such as gender, BMI, or age. Among cultures, non-Western countries had a higher prevalence of SBDE prevalence than Western countries, but the difference was not significant. There was considerable variability in the prevalence estimates as a function of the assessment measure, but no meaningful pattern emerged.

There is a great need for innovative, integrated policy and program development all along the spectrum of health promotion and universal, selective, and indicated prevention. Further research is also needed to validate and refine this estimate by (a) conducting basic research on the accuracy of eating disorder screening measurements in samples ages 14 through 17; (b) examining representative samples in more countries in general and Latin American countries in particular; (c) clarifying the relationships between SBDE and age throughout the different phases of late childhood, adolescence, and emerging adulthood; and (d) investigating whether there are meaningful forms of disordered eating and whether these are associated with variables such as gender, ethnicity, and BMI.","2023-08-03","2023-08-21 13:15:51","2023-12-01 14:49:48","2023-08-21 13:15:50","128","","1","11","","J Eat Disord","The global prevalence of screen-based disordered eating and associated risk factors among high school students","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Carbon offsets are issued based on ex-ante estimates of project emissions reductions, though systematic evidence on ex-post evaluations of achieved emissions reductions is missing. We synthesized existing rigorous empirical studies evaluating more than 2,000 offset projects across all major offset sectors. Our analysis shows that offset projects achieved considerably lower emissions reductions than officially claimed. We estimate that only 12% of the total volume of existing credits constitute real emissions reductions, with 0% for renewable energy, 0.4% for cookstoves, 25.0% for forestry and 27.5% for chemical processes. Our results thus indicate that 88% of the total credit volume across these four sectors in the voluntary carbon market does not constitute real emissions reductions. This offset achievement gap corresponds to almost twice the annual German CO              2              emissions. We complement evidence from offset projects with 51 additional studies conducting ex-post evaluations of field interventions with settings comparable to offset projects. For cookstoves and forestry projects, these field interventions were more effective at reducing emissions than the voluntary offset projects, likely due to more careful intervention targeting, stricter monitoring and enforcement of intervention protocols.","2023-07-27","2023-08-21 13:30:56","2023-12-01 14:49:44","2023-08-21 13:30:55","","","","","","","","","","","","In Review","","","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-3149652/v1","","","","","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the years, as recommended methods for guideline production have evolved, the CTS guideline process has become more rigorous and lengthier. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this model was challenged by the urgent need for guidance, insufficient time for conventional guideline processes, and shrinking human resources and capacity. Accordingly, the CTS pivoted from guidelines to the more rapid, narrative, and informal “position statement” format. Having produced 17 COVID-related statements, the CTS saw its guideline website visits increase by 90% and downloads by 63% in 2020 versus 2019. However, providing rapid guidance in the form of position statements necessitates a significant tradeoff in the rigor of methodological processes used to arrive at recommendations. Previous research suggests that robust “rapid guidelines” may be feasible through modifications to conventional guideline development processes. Such approaches were successfully implemented by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), the World Health Organization, and the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for COVID–19–related guidelines. Rapid guidelines have been made more feasible by better information sharing and advancing technologies such as an online COVID network meta-analysis engine and an app that allows organizations to author, publish and update digital guidelines. The CTS must continue to produce urgent guidance for decision makers, providers and the public alike in the context of this pandemic and should explore opportunities to espouse a standardized, rigorous and transparent process for rapid guidelines.","2021-11-02","2022-02-15 16:03:56","2024-09-05 21:10:15","2022-02-15 11:42:40","343-345","","6","5","","","Providing clinical guidance in the middle of a global pandemic","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/24745332.2021.1992319","","","","peer_reviewed_article; other","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to current recommendations, systematic searching should combine electronic database searching with supplementary search methods. One such supplementary search method is citation tracking. It aims at collecting directly and/or indirectly cited and citing references from &quot;seed references&quot;. Tailored and evidence-guided recommendations concerning the use of citation tracking are strongly needed. Objective: We intend to develop recommendations for the use of citation tracking in systematic literature searching for health-related topics. Our study will be guided by the following research questions: What is the benefit of citation tracking for systematic literature searching for health-related topics? Which methods, citation indexes, and other tools are used for citation tracking? What terminology is used for citation tracking methods? Methods: Our study will have two parts: a scoping review and a Delphi study. The scoping review aims at identifying methodological studies on the benefit and use of citation tracking in systematic literature searching for health-related topics with no restrictions on study design, language, and publication date. We will perform database searching in MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Web of Science Core Collection, two information science databases, web searching, and contact experts in the field.

The scientic literature on these adaptation policies is fragmented and no central typology is generally accepted, making tracking of global adaptation policy progress dicult. Methods — In this protocol, we describe how we use machine learning methods to classify scientic literature on adaptation policies following the ROSES guidelines. We use a broad search query in Scopus, MEDLINE and Web of Science (up to November 2021). We manually classify a subset of the documents and use this to train multiple supervised machine learning algorithms, including a state-of-the-art algorithm based on BERT. The classication scheme is aimed at providing a multi-functional database: we classify rst based on a newly created typology, which is based around the well-established NATO categories of policy instruments; this is supplemented with categories on the types of impacts, evidence on maladaptation, constraints, evidence type, governance level and geographic location. Expected results – Using the typology and categories, as well as topic modelling, we create an overview of scientic literature on adaptation policies. This describes the breath of policy options, their geographic distribution, developments over time, and under-explored areas. If successful, this would result in the most comprehensive evidence map of adaptation policies to date; building on this, the machine learning algorithms and underlying data can serve as a basis for a living evidence map, moving towards the realtime tracking of adaptation progress.","2022-02-25","2022-03-09 08:07:33","2025-02-27 13:22:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","protocol","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As domain knowledge accumulates, scientists will need new computational approaches for identifying relevant literature to read and include in formal literature reviews and meta-analyses. Importantly, these approaches can also facilitate automated, large-scale data synthesis tasks and build structured databases from the information in the texts of primary journal articles, textbooks, grey literature, and websites. The increasing availability of digital text, computational resources, and machine-learning based language models have led to a revolution in text analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in recent years. NLP has been widely adopted across the biomedical sciences, but is rarely used in ecology and evolutionary biology. Applying computational tools from text mining and NLP will increase the efficiency of data synthesis, improve the reproducibility of literature reviews, formalize analyses of research biases and knowledge gaps, and promote data-driven discovery of patterns across ecology and evolutionary biology. Here we present recent use cases from ecology and evolution, and discuss future applications, limitations, and ethical issues.","2022-02-16","2022-02-22 07:34:52","2024-09-05 21:13:34","2022-02-22 07:34:52","","","","","","","","","","","","EcoEvoRxiv","","en-us","","","","","OSF Preprints","","DOI: 10.32942/osf.io/c4kvq","","","","non-peer_reviewed_article; other","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For many tasks - including but not limited to systematic reviews and meta-analyses - the scientific literature needs to be checked systematically. Currently, scholars and practitioners screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase of available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided pipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of simulation studies that ASReview can yield far more efficient reviewing than manual reviewing, while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the options of the free and open source research software and present the results from user experience tests. We invite the community to contribute to open source projects such as our own that provide measurable and reproducible improvements over current practice.","2021-02","2022-04-06 09:58:30","2023-12-01 14:50:06","2022-04-06 09:58:30","125-133","","2","3","","Nat Mach Intell","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2006.12166","","","","ASR_team_publication; non-peer_reviewed_article","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The efficacy of house dust mite (HDM) allergen immunotherapy (AIT) compared between monosensitized and polysensitized patients remains limited. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the efficacy and safety of HDM AIT compared between monosensitized and polysensitized patients with allergic rhinitis. METHODS: We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and the Cochrane central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) until June 2022. The primary outcome was the changes from baseline in total nasal symptom score (TNSS). Secondary outcomes were changes from baseline in total medication score (TMS), combined symptom medication score (CSMS), visual analog scale (VAS), Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) score, immunological parameters, and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Of 13 eligible studies, 10 prospective cohorts, 2 retrospective cohorts, and 1 matched cohort, we identified 10 studies for quantitative synthesis. There were 1,113 patients with allergic rhinitis, 566 with HDM monosensitization and 547 with polysensitization to HDM and other allergens. There was no significant difference in the pooled mean changes of the 2 groups in TNSS (SMD -0.05, 95%CI: -0.22 to 0.11, p = 0.532) and VAS (SMD -0.20, 95%CI: -0.42 to 0.01, p = 0.060) with moderate certainty of evidence. The changes in TMS, CSMS, and RQLQ were similar between the 2 groups with very low certainty of evidence. The AEs were mild and comparable between the 2 groups. The immunological indices remained inconsistent and were not predictive of clinical responses. CONCLUSIONS: A single HDM AIT similarly improved clinical outcomes in monosensitized and polysensitized patients with allergic rhinitis.","2022-12-01","2023-01-05 13:25:00","2025-03-13 15:01:29","","337-352","","4","40","","Asian Pac J Allergy Immunol","House dust mite allergen immunotherapy for monosensitized versus polysensitized patients with allergic rhinitis","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36278778","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36278778","multiple_screeners; peer_reviewed_article; systematic_review; stopping_rule","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The wealth of research available on the BRI has been subject to few comprehensive reviews to date, reviews including both English and Chinese language research are even rarer still. In addition, many of the projects associated with the BRI involve infrastructure development, power generation and transmission system development leading to concern around environmental sustainability. As a result, China proposed the “Green BRI” concept in 2017 to improve the environmental credentials of the initiative and enhance sustainability, yet the assessment of how the BRI is tied to sustainability is still unsure. In this study, we use the methodology of systematic review to address the following questions: 1) what the overall feature of BRI impact related research is; 2) how have the impacts of BRI been measured; 3) what gaps exist in terms of the scale of impact addressed by the literature; 4) how many studies map with environmental-focused SDGs; 5) what percentage of impact literature on the BRI is focused on environment or biodiversity; 6) is there a language bias between Chinese- and English-language literature. This review provides value as it examines PR and non-PR research to assess how observers in both English and Chinese are prioritizing and presenting the impacts of the BRI to improve understanding of the information available within different decision-making contexts. This study shows that, to date though, there remains no agreed definition or set of matrices of what constitutes green development under the BRI, meaning specific guidance on what can be defined as green (type of project) and what measurement structure is required (including prior informed consent of communities, independent impact assessments, strategic assessments) is unavailable. The BRI research is not discussed along with SDGs or sustainability as we expect. There is scope and need to consider how the sustainability of the BRI can be evaluated so that improvement solutions can be developed for its accountability and sustainability. To add, in both English- and Chinese-language publications, the non-peer-reviewed papers tend toward a more polarized interpretation of the likely impacts of BRI projects whilst peer-reviewed publications offered a more nuanced assessment. Papers in Chinese provide more qualitative discussions of the BRI whilst papers in English give more quantitative assessments. In both languages, the discussion around BRI impacts is qualitative, suggesting a lack of data on which to base quantitative research and develop clear and specific recommendations for action.","2022-11-21","2023-03-13 08:17:51","2023-12-01 14:50:01","2023-03-13 08:17:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","CC BY Attribution 4.0 International","","","","eartharxiv.org","","Publisher: EarthArXiv","","","","systematic_review; non-peer_reviewed_article","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We map the existing exposure data landscape to requirements for data analytics and repositories across European policies and regulations. We further identify needs and ways forward for improving data generation, sharing, and usage, and translate identified needs into an operational action plan for European and global advancement of exposure data for policies and regulations. Identified key areas of action are to develop consistent exposure data standards and terminology for data production and reporting, increase data transparency and availability, enhance data storage and related infrastructure, boost automation in data management, increase data integration, and advance tools for innovative data analysis. Improving and streamlining exposure data generation and uptake into science and policy is crucial for the European Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability and European Digital Strategy, in line with EU Data policies on data management and interoperability.","2022-12-01","2023-01-05 13:33:31","2023-12-01 14:50:01","2023-01-05 13:33:31","107610","","","170","","Environment International","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","","","peer_reviewed_article; mention_only","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To date, there are several methodological resources available from international organizations such as the Cochrane Collaboration that aim to aid researchers in conducting high-quality secondary research and promoting reproducibility, transparency and scientific rigour. Nevertheless, researchers still face challenges in most stages of evidence synthesis. Open research and the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles are rising initiatives being increasingly implemented in primary research. However, their beneficial role in secondary research is less emphasized. This article addresses how the challenges commonly faced during evidence synthesis research could be overcome using open research practices and currently available open research tools. Despite the phenomenally simple SR workflow, researchers still find tasks such as framing the SR research question, search strategy development, data extraction, and assessing for bias, challenging. The implementation of FAIR practices, including prospective registration at the PROSPERO database, abiding with the PRISMA guidelines, and making all SR data openly available could have significant benefits in avoiding duplication of effort and reducing research waste while improving the reporting standards of SRs. Additionally, this article highlights the need for further education in open research culture to overcome ethical and motivational barriers in implementing open research practices in evidence synthesis. Finally, in the era of technological breakthroughs, artificial intelligence may eventually be incorporated into the process of SRs and should abide by the FAIR standards for open research.","2022-12-05","2023-01-05 13:22:16","2023-12-01 14:50:00","2023-01-05 13:22:16","","","","","","","The role of open research in improving the standards of evidence synthesis","","","","","F1000Research","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","f1000research.com","","DOI: 10.12688/f1000research.127179.1","","","","non-peer_reviewed_article; SR_methodology; mention_only","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","11:1435","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current three-level meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to provide a quantitative estimate of the strength of the association between maternal childhood maltreatment and child externalizing behaviour and to summarise research on potential mediating factors of this association. PsycINFO, PubMed, and Embase were searched and 39 studies with 82 effects sizes were included in the meta-analysis. Results revealed a small significant association between maternal childhood maltreatment and child externalizing behaviour (r = 0.16; 95% CI 0.12–0.19; publication bias-adjusted effect size: r = 0.12, 95% CI 0.08–0.16). Maternal mental health, particularly depressive symptoms, maternal parenting and children’s maltreatment exposure were the most frequently examined mediators of this association, with relatively robust mediating effects for children’s maltreatment exposure and maternal depressive symptoms, but mixed evidence for the mediating role of maternal parenting. This meta-analysis provides evidence for a small but significant association between maternal childhood maltreatment and children’s externalizing behaviour, emphasizing the need to develop effective preventive and intervention strategies to minimise the effects of childhood maltreatment on the next generation.","2022-12-04","2023-01-05 13:22:34","2023-12-01 14:50:00","2023-01-05 13:22:34","","","","","","Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry","The impact of maternal childhood maltreatment on child externalizing behaviour and the mediating factors underlying this association","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","multiple_screeners; peer_reviewed_article; systematic_review; stopping_rule","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the avalanche of publications makes the norm challenging to follow. Text mining (TM) is efficient in extracting information from corpora. Still, it cannot discover materials not present in the corpora, hindering its broader applications in exploring novel materials, such as high-entropy alloys (HEAs). Here we introduce a concept of “context similarity"" for selecting chemical elements for HEAs, based on TM models that analyze the abstracts of 6.4 million papers. The method captures the similarity of chemical elements in the context used by scientists. It overcomes the limitations of TM and identifies the Cantor and Senkov HEAs. We demonstrate its screening capability for six- and seven-component lightweight HEAs by finding nearly 500 promising alloys out of 2.6 million candidates. The method thus brings an approach to the development of ultrahigh-entropy alloys and multicomponent materials.","2023-01-04","2023-04-03 14:42:40","2023-12-01 14:50:00","2023-04-03 14:42:40","54","","1","14","","Nat Commun","","","","","","","","en","2023 The Author(s)","","","","www-nature-com.proxy.library.uu.nl","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","","","","peer_reviewed_article; mention_only","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Challenging because intellectual property, especially in a digital form, can be easily copied, deployed, stolen or misappropriated. Critical because nowadays intellectual property is everywhere, it is present in all areas of economic activities, it enables companies to create competitive moat and its attached monetary value is material. Knowledge should also be openly available; therefore, intellectual property law is basically about finding the right balance between authors´ interests (protection, enforcement, monetization) and users' interests (usage, access). Blockchain and its underlying technology of distributed ledgers has the potential to disrupt the way intellectual properties are managed, protected and monetized. Where the access and distribution of content has been revolutionized by the internet, distributed ledger technology might offer an alternative path helping intellectual property law enter the digital age and address its original intent which is at its core to protect and reward creators, enable open access to knowledge in order to foster innovation. In this paper we conduct a PRISMA guided systematic literature review of 176 scientific publications in the field of blockchain-based management of intellectual property. We use a PESTEL framework to investigate the benefits as well as the limitations of using distributed ledger technology to manage intellectual property. Additionally, we provide recommendations on how the identified challenges can be addressed, as well as future research directions.","2022-12-19","2023-04-03 14:29:15","2023-12-01 14:50:00","2023-04-03 14:29:15","","","","","","Inf Syst E-Bus Manage","Impact of blockchain and distributed ledger technology for the management, protection, enforcement and monetization of intellectual property","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","","","peer_reviewed_article; systematic_review","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Overall, the media was positive about nudges. Nudging was viewed as an effective and efficient way to change behavior and received considerable support across the political spectrum. The media also noted that nudges were easy to implement. The controversy about nudges concerns themes like paternalism, fear of manipulation, small effect sizes, and unintended consequences. Academic proponents of nudging were actively involved in media debates, while critical voices were less often heard. There were some reports criticizing how the government used nudges.

This review aims to facilitate screening tool selection through a systematic narrative review and feature analysis. The current adoption rate of transparent tool reporting is low: by screening 191 studies published in the Review of Educational Research since 2015, we found that only eight studies reported screening tools. More research is needed to understand the reasons behind this phenomenon. After consulting various sources, 26 available screening tools in the market were found. Among them, we identified and evaluated 12 screening tools for educational reviewers and ranked them in descending order of feature score: Covidence (1), DistillerSR (2, tied), EPPI-Reviewer (2, tied), CADIMA (4), Swift-Active (5), Rayyan (6, tied), SysRev (6, tied), Abstrackr (8, tied), ReLiS (8, tied), RevMan (8, tied), ASReview (11), and Excel (12). In the discussion, we provide insights into the promise and bias in tools' machine learning algorithms.

We aimed to identify and summarise interventions for work participation of unemployed or work-disabled cancer survivors.Methods: Five databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Library) were systematically searched for quantitative studies on interventions aimed at enhancing work participation of unemployed or work-disabled cancer survivors. Work participation refers to participation in the workforce, fulfilling one's work role. Manual and automatic screening (with ASReview software) were performed on titles and abstracts, followed by manual full-text screening. Data were extracted regarding study, patient and intervention characteristics, and work participation outcomes. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB2 and QUIPS tools.Results: We identified 10,771 articles, of which we included two randomised controlled trials (RCTs), of which one feasibility RCT, and three cohort studies. In total, 1862 cancer survivors were included, with predominantly breast cancer. Work participation was mainly measured as time to return to work (RTW) and RTW rate. Interventions included components of coaching (e.g., psychological or rehabilitation), training (e.g., building confidence and managing fatigue) and self-management. Two RCTs with unclear RoB did not show an effect of multicomponent interventions compared to care as usual. One cohort study found a significant effect of a psycho-educational intervention on RTW rates, with moderate RoB. The other two cohort studies, with moderate RoB, reported significant associations between components including job search and placement assistance, and work participation.Discussion: Only few interventions aimed at enhancing work participation of unemployed or work-disabled cancer survivors, have been evaluated. In two cohort studies, promising components for future multicomponent interventions were identified. However, findings suggest that more evidence is necessary on such multicomponent interventions, in which elements explicitly directed at work and including the workplace should be included.","2023-04-03","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","753-764","","7","62","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis","","","","Cancer Survivorship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We thus provide an improved more integrated theory of FIAD, able to guide both research priorities and the diagnostic formulation of FIAD. We systematically address the diverse spectrum of clinical presentations of FND with impaired awareness, and offer a new framework for understanding FIAD. We find that unraveling the historical development of neurobiological theory of FIAD is of paramount importance for its current understanding. Then, we integrate contemporary clinical material in order to contextualise the neurobiology of FIAD within social, cultural, and psychological perspectives. We thus review neuro-computational insights in FND in general, to arrive at a more coherent account of FIAD. FIAD may be based on maladaptive predictive coding, shaped by stress, attention, uncertainty, and, ultimately, neurally encoded beliefs and their updates. We also critically appraise arguments in support of and against such Bayesian models. Finally, we discuss implications of our theoretical account and provide pointers towards an improved clinical diagnostic formulation of FIAD.

Urban floods cause severe damages to cities and their inhabitants, and they are expected to increase over time. Consequently, urban adaptation is required to shift from traditional infrastructure to Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI). Until recently, studies on BGI implementation have centred around large cities in developed countries. Meanwhile, medium and small size cities have received less attention. According to the Urban Water Management Transition Framework (UWMTF), cities can leapfrog towards more 'water sensitive' practices. Although leapfrogging is context-dependent, our understanding of how governance factors support leapfrogging remains embryonic. This paper contributes to the scholarly understanding of the governance factors that support and limit leapfrogging. By applying the Governance Assessment Tool (GAT) and considering three catalytic factors that underpin leapfrogging, this research assessed the process to implement the BGI project named Olympiadelaan in Herentals, Belgium. Overall, the governance context support was assessed as moderate. The regional and provincial governments play a key role in reaching this moderate level of support. This moderate support helps the city level to speed up its urban water management transition, but it is not enough to skip the states in the UWMTF.","2021-10-01","2022-02-15 16:03:56","2025-03-13 15:01:15","","103331-103331","","","117","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","Sustainability Transitions; peer_reviewed_article; other; Adaptive Governance; Urban Flooding; Urban Hydrology; Urban Stormwater Management","/unread; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, much research has attempted to identify the leading causes of this decline, and a multifactorial synergism (i.e., different stressors acting together and mutually potentiating the harmful effects) seems to be the emerging consensus explaining this phenomenon. The emphasis on some stressor groups such as agrochemicals, and pollinators such as the honey bee Apis mellifera , can hide the real risk of anthropogenic stressors on pollinating insects. In the present study, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify general and temporal trends in publications, considering the different groups of pollinators and their exposure to agrochemicals over the last 76 years. Through an artificial intelligence (AI)-aided meta-analysis, we quantitatively assessed trends in publications on bee groups and agrochemicals. Using AI tools through machine learning enabled efficient evaluation of a large volume of published articles. Toxicological assessment of the impact of agrochemicals on insect pollinators is dominated by the order Hymenoptera, which includes honey bees. Although honey bees are well-explored, there is a lack of published articles exploring the toxicological assessment of agrochemicals for bumble bees, solitary bees, and stingless bees.

It has been suggested that financial scarcity could also impair dietary behavior, through a decline in self-control. Underlying cognitive mechanisms of tunneling (directing attention to financial issues and neglecting other demands), cognitive load (a tax on mental bandwidth interfering with executive functioning) and time orientation (a shift towards a present time horizon, versus a future time horizon) may explain the association between financial scarcity and self-control related dietary behavior. The current scoping review gathers recent evidence on how these mechanisms affect dietary behavior of people experiencing financial scarcity. It builds on a theoretical framework based on insights from behavioral economics and health psychology.A literature search was executed in six online databases, which resulted in 9.975 papers. Search terms were tunneling, cognitive load and time orientation, financial scarcity, and dietary behavior. Screening was performed with ASReview, an AI-ranking tool. In total, 14 papers were included in the scoping review. We used PRISMA-ScR guidelines for reporting.Limited evidence indicates that a scarcity mindset could increase tunneling, through attentional narrowing on costs of food, which then directly impacts dietary behavior. A scarcity mindset involves experiencing financial stress, which can be understood as cognitive load. Cognitive load decreases attentional capacity, which could impair self-control in dietary choices. Financial scarcity is related to a present time orientation, which affects dietary choices by shifting priorities and decreasing motivation for healthy dietary behavior.A scarcity mindset affects dietary behavior in different ways. Tunneling and a shift in time orientation are indicative of an attentional redirection, which can be seen as more adaptive to the situation.

It focuses on the distribution of biotic and abiotic sounds at different frequencies of the landscape acoustic attribute and the relationship of said sounds with ecosystem health metrics and indicators (e.g., species richness, acoustic biodiversity, vectors of structural change, gradients of vegetation cover, landscape connectivity, and temporal and spatial characteristics). To conduct such studies, researchers analyze recordings from Acoustic Recording Units (ARUs). The increasing use of ARUs and their capacity to record hours of audio for months at a time have created a need for automatic processing methods to reduce time consumption, correlate variables implicit in the recordings, extract features, and characterize sound patterns related to landscape attributes. Consequently, traditional machine learning methods have been commonly used to process data on different characteristics of soundscapes, mainly the presence–absence of species. In addition, it has been employed for call segmentation, species identification, and sound source clustering. However, some authors highlight the importance of the new approaches that use unsupervised deep learning methods to improve the results and diversify the assessed attributes. In this paper, we present a systematic review of machine learning methods used in the field of ecoacoustics for data processing. It includes recent trends, such as semi-supervised and unsupervised deep learning methods. Moreover, it maintains the format found in the reviewed papers. First, we describe the ARUs employed in the papers analyzed, their configuration, and the study sites where the datasets were collected. Then, we provide an ecological justification that relates acoustic monitoring to landscape features. Subsequently, we explain the machine learning methods followed to assess various landscape attributes. The results show a trend towards label-free methods that can process the large volumes of data gathered in recent years. Finally, we discuss the need to adopt methods with a machine learning approach in other biological dimensions of landscapes.","2023-10-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","e20275-e20275","","10","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","Acoustic Communications; Acoustic Scene Classification; Anthropogenic Noise; Audio Signal Classification; Environmental Sound Recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in research interest not only in identifying the mechanisms underlying defined pathologies but also in redefining their etiology. This is particularly relevant for the field of personalized medicine, which searches for data-driven approaches to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection for individual patients. Methods: This review aims to provide a high-level overview of the rapidly growing field of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from the perspective of unsupervised machine learning applications for disease subtyping. Following the PRISMA guidelines for protocol reproducibility, we searched the PubMed database for articles describing functional MRI applications used to obtain, interpret, or validate psychiatric disease subtypes. We also employed the active learning framework ASReview to prioritize publications in a machine learning-guided way. Results: From the 20 studies that met the inclusion criteria, five used functional MRI data to interpret symptom-derived disease clusters, four used it to interpret clusters derived from biomarker data other than fMRI itself, and 11 applied clustering techniques involving fMRI directly. Major depression disorder and schizophrenia were the two most frequently studied pathologies (35% and 30% of the retrieved studies, respectively), followed by ADHD (15%), psychosis as a whole (10%), autism disorder (5%), and the consequences of early exposure to violence (5%). Conclusions: The increased interest in personalized medicine and data-driven disease subtyping also extends to psychiatric disorders. However, to date, this subfield is at an incipient exploratory stage, and all retrieved studies were mostly proofs of principle where further validation and increased sample sizes are craved for. Whereas results for all explored diseases are inconsistent, we believe this reflects the need for concerted, multisite data collection efforts with a strong focus on measuring the generalizability of results. Finally, whereas functional MRI is the best way of measuring brain function available to date, its low signal-to-noise ratio and elevated monetary cost make it a poor clinical alternative. Even with technology progressing and costs decreasing, this might incentivize the search for more accessible, clinically ready functional proxies in the future.","2021-10-22","2022-02-15 16:03:56","2025-03-13 15:03:17","","","","","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media","","","","Neuroimaging Data Analysis; peer_reviewed_article; systematic_review; stopping_rule; Neuroimaging; Resting-State fMRI","/unread; ⛔ No DOI found","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One promising novel approach is federated learning, a machine learning approach that allows multiple devices to train a shared model without exchanging raw data. Instead of centralizing the data in one location, each device or machine holds a portion of the data and collaborates with other devices to update the shared model. In this way, federated learning enables training on more extensive and diverse datasets than would be possible with centralized training while preserving the privacy and security of individual data. In the mental health domain, federated learning has the potential to improve mental disorders’ detection, diagnosis, and treatment. By pooling data from multiple sources while maintaining patient privacy by keeping data secure and ensuring that they are not used for unauthorized purposes. This literature survey reviews recent studies that have exploited federated learning in the psychiatric domain, covering multiple data resources and different machine-learning techniques.

The active learning process continually improves its predictions on the remaining unlabeled records, with the goal of identifying all relevant records as early as possible. However, determining the optimal point at which to stop the active learning process is a challenge. The cost of additional labeling of records by the reviewer must be balanced against the cost of erroneous exclusions. This paper introduces the SAFE procedure, a practical and conservative set of stopping heuristics that offers a clear guideline for determining when to end the active learning process in screening software like ASReview. The eclectic mix of stopping heuristics helps to minimize the risk of missing relevant papers in the screening process. The proposed stopping heuristic balances the costs of continued screening with the risk of missing relevant records, providing a practical solution for reviewers to make informed decisions on when to stop screening. Although active learning can significantly enhance the quality and efficiency of screening, this method may be more applicable to certain types of datasets and problems. Ultimately, the decision to stop the active learning process depends on careful consideration of the trade-off between the costs of additional record labeling against the potential errors of the current model for the specific dataset and context.","2024-03-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2025-03-26 09:56:33","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","","","ASR_team_publication; stefano_checked; systematic_review_methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A disadvantage to systematic reviews, however, is that this process is time-consuming and requires expert domain knowledge. The work reported here aims to reduce the time needed by an expert to screen all possible relevant articles by applying machine learning techniques to classify the articles automatically as either relevant or not relevant. Eight different machine learning algorithms and ensembles of all combinations of these algorithms were tested on two different systematic reviews on food safety (i.e. chemical hazards in cereals and leafy greens). The results showed that the best performance was obtained by an ensemble of naive Bayes and a support vector machine, resulting in an average decrease of 32.8% in the amount of articles the expert has to read and an average decrease in irrelevant articles of 57.8% while keeping 95% of the relevant articles.

Thus, this work proposes a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) design as a novel approach for collecting the body of contributions for any given research field in general and sustainability in particular. This design is guided by a semi-automated procedure that aims at incorporating the best automation features of earlier SLRs and involves available scientific databases, e.g., Scopus and Web of Science. The results of the proposed SLR design include bibliometric analyses, a list of researcher and institution networks, and a qualitative assessment of practical applications of the field of interest. Moreover, the proposed semi-automated approach allows for the inclusion of subject categorization based on the generation of author-density maps and keyword co-occurrence networks. For illustration, the semi-automated SLR design is implemented by thoroughly reviewing the contributions pertaining to the P-graph (Process Graph) framework with a focus on sustainability. The P-graph framework has been applied to multiple areas, such as network design, optimization, and system integration; in particular, the framework has proven to be useful for the development of sustainable systems. Upon execution, the semi-automated SLR design collected 284 contributions related to P-graph, of which 139 were classified as sustainability-related, and further partitioned into specific categories. It is expected that the proposed semi-automated SLR design will help researchers in the sustainability community accelerate the generation of works in that area by rapidly generating accurate literature reviews.","2023-08-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","137741-137741","","","415","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","Supply Chain Network Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The existing body of research on academic achievement and the effectiveness of mindset interventions for student learning largely relies on the premise that fixed and growth mindsets are mutually exclusive. This premise has led to the common practice in which measures of one mindset are reversed and then assumed to represent the other mindset. Focusing on K-12 and university students (N = 27328), we tested the validity of this practice via a comprehensive item-level meta-analysis of the Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale (ITIS). By means of meta-analytic structural equation modeling and network analysis, we examined (a) the ITIS item-item correlations and their heterogeneity across 32 primary studies; (b) the factor structure of the ITIS, including the distinction between fixed and growth mindset; and (c) moderator effects of sample, study, and measurement characteristics. We found positive item-item correlations within the sets of fixed and growth mindset items, with substantial between-study heterogeneity. The ITIS factor structure comprised two moderately correlated mindset factors (ρ = 0.63–0.65), even after reversing one mindset scale. This structure was moderated by the educational level and origin of the student sample, the assessment mode, and scale modifications. Overall, we argue that fixed and growth mindsets are not mutually exclusive but correlated constructs. We discuss the implications for the assessment of implicit theories of intelligence in education.","2022-11-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","100479-100479","","","37","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","Interest Development; Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, a diverse set of social sustainability indicators has been developed in addition to the better-studied environmental and economic dimensions. However, these social indicators are dispersed in the literature, resulting in limited structured knowledge of the social dimension of sustainability. This study provides a Systematic Literature Review of 128 research articles on assessing social sustainability in agri-food systems. By conducting an in-depth analysis of relevant social sustainability indicators in the agri-food sector, the study creates a centralised knowledge base on social sustainability indicators to guide empirical investigations in agri-food systems. Thirty-six indicators were identified and structured into eight themes. These indicators have been analysed along key dimensions for decision-making: the spatial scale, the type of agri-food system, the Theory of Change (ToC) level, and the temporal scale. Indicators were found at the farm, community/local, regional, and supra-regional spatial scales. Regarding the type of agri-food system, indicators are predominantly used for integrated and cropping systems and less for exclusive food systems analyses, livestock, forest, plantation-based systems, aquaculture, and fisheries. Activity level indicators are the most dominant considering the levels along the ToC. On temporal aspects, the keywords related to social sustainability indicators are identical before and after the SDGs but have, on average, been used much more since the advent of the SDGs in 2015. A word embedding algorithm detected shifts in the debate, with issues of water access, gender equity, and participation becoming increasingly important in assessing the social sustainability of agri-food systems. The results open up a fruitful avenue of research on integrating social sustainability indicators into decision-making processes for more sustainable food production.","2023-07-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","175-190","","","39","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","Agricultural Sustainability; Sustainability Indicators; Sustainability Labels","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, the review shows that OGD law has many faces and cannot be reduced to one single piece of 'OGD legislation'. Instead, OGD law covers a wide range of topics, dealing with access to information, re-use of information, and conflicting interests (e.g. privacy or copyright). Secondly, the article identifies three main dimensions that structure the assessment of the impact of OGD law on OGD practices: topics of OGD law, sources of OGD law, and levels of OGD law. Finally, the review shows that there is no clear and univocal evidence to answer the question of what regulatory constellation is successful in fostering OGD practices and what is not, partly due to a lack of available empirical research. At the same time, the literature reveals some promising avenues for future research on OGD law in action.","2023-06-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","101823-101823","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","Open Data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the extensive time and expertise required to analyze numerous drafts of student writing pose a barrier to teaching. Automated writing evaluation (AWE) tools can be used for individual feedback based on advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. A number of primary (quasi-)experimental studies have investigated the effect of AWE feedback on students' writing performance. Methods This paper provides a meta-analysis of the effectiveness of AWE feedback tools. The literature search yielded 4,462 entries, of which 20 studies ( k = 84; N = 2, 828) met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. A moderator analysis investigated the impact of the characteristics of the learner, the intervention, and the outcome measures. Results Overall, results based on a three-level model with random effects show a medium effect ( g = 0.55) of automated feedback on students' writing performance. However, the significant heterogeneity in the data indicates that the use of automated feedback tools cannot be understood as a single consistent form of intervention. Even though for some of the moderators we found substantial differences in effect sizes, none of the subgroup comparisons were statistically significant. Discussion We discuss these findings in light of automated feedback use in educational practice and give recommendations for future research.","2023-07-03","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","","","","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Frontiers Media","","","","Student Performance Prediction; Dynamic Assessment; Assessment Literacy; Formative Assessment; Peer Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mobility systems represent good examples of provisioning systems required to gain access to essential services and for human connectivity. They also act, however, as a significant source of environmental degradation and are subject to significant social inequalities associated with transport accessibility, affordability, and social externalities, such as traffic fatalities and local air pollution. Sustainable mobility indicator and 'safe and just space' studies have thus far struggled to capture a strong state of sustainability (as opposed to relative improvement measurements), at a sectoral depth that allows for actionable insight, respectively. This work thus reviewed both literature fields, collecting mobility indicators as well as sectoral ecological and social thresholds, and organized them according to a developed strong sustainability framework. Through this approach, this work accomplishes three goals: 1) assists in characterizing a 'safe and just space' for mobility provisioning systems through the development of an indicator system 2) Provides a layered understanding of their use and suggests future use of them 3) Provides an organized basket of indicators for practitioners to make use of. In achieving these goals, this work helps connect social and ecological thresholds for the transport sector at a granular level, assisting practitioners in applying and measuring strong sustainability states for mobility provisioning.","2023-06-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","100240-100240","","","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","Environmental Correlates; Sustainability Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although machine learning and natural language processing algorithms may reduce this time and these resources, their performance has not been tested in education and educational psychology, and there is a lack of clear information on when researchers should stop the reviewing process. In this study, we conducted a retrospective screening simulation using 27 systematic reviews in education and educational psychology. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and estimated time savings of several learning algorithms and heuristic stopping criteria. The results showed, on average, a 58% ( SD = 19%) reduction in the screening workload of irrelevant records when using learning algorithms for abstract screening and an estimated time savings of 1.66 days ( SD = 1.80). The learning algorithm random forests with sentence bidirectional encoder representations from transformers outperformed other algorithms. This finding emphasizes the importance of incorporating semantic and contextual information during feature extraction and modeling in the screening process. Furthermore, we found that 95% of all relevant abstracts within a given dataset can be retrieved using heuristic stopping rules. Specifically, an approach that stops the screening process after classifying 20% of records and consecutively classifying 5% of irrelevant papers yielded the most significant gains in terms of specificity ( M = 42%, SD = 28%). However, the performance of the heuristic stopping criteria depended on the learning algorithm used and the length and proportion of relevant papers in an abstract collection. Our study provides empirical evidence on the performance of machine learning screening algorithms for abstract screening in systematic reviews in education and educational psychology.","2024-02-08","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2025-03-26 10:03:37","","","","1","36","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science+Business Media","","","","stefano_checked; systematic_review_tool_comparison","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These risk–benefit assessments may involve determining an optimal dose compared against historic external comparators of a particular disease indication. MBMA can provide a flexible framework for interpreting aggregated data from historic reference studies and therefore should be a standard tool for the model-informed drug development (MIDD) framework. In addition to pairwise and network meta-analyses, MBMA provides further contributions in the quantitative approaches with its ability to incorporate longitudinal data and the pharmacologic concept of dose–response relationship, as well as to combine individual- and summary-level data and routinely incorporate covariates in the analysis. A common application of MBMA is the selection of optimal dose and dosing regimen of the internal investigational molecule to evaluate external benchmarking and to support comparator selection. Two case studies provided examples in applications of MBMA in biologics (durvalumab + tremelimumab for safety) and small molecule (fenebrutinib for efficacy) to support drug development decision-making in two different but well-studied disease areas, i.e., oncology and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively. Important to the future directions of MBMA include additional recognition and engagement from drug development stakeholders for the MBMA approach, stronger collaboration between pharmacometrics and statistics, expanded data access, and the use of machine learning for database building. Timely, cost-effective, and successful application of MBMA should be part of providing an integrated view of MIDD.","2022-02-16","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","1761-1777","","8","39","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science+Business Media","","","","Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

No systematic reviews or meta-analyses have pooled adherence to the recommendation across multiple studies. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of preschool-aged children achieving the WHO’s physical activity recommendation for young children, and determine if the prevalence differed between boys and girls. Methods Primary literature searches were conducted on six online databases and a machine learning assisted systematic review was used to identify relevant studies. Studies written in English reporting on the prevalence of children aged 3–5 years achieving overall WHO physical activity recommendation or the individual TPA or MVPA aspects of the recommendation measured using accelerometers were eligible for inclusion. Random effects meta-analysis was used to determine the prevalence of preschools achieving the overall WHO recommendation and the individual TPA and MVPA aspect of the recommendation, and to determine difference in prevalence between boys and girls. Results Forty-eight studies reporting on 20,078 preschool-aged children met the inclusion criteria. Based on the most commonly employed accelerometer cut-points across all aspects of the recommendation, 60% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 37%, 79%) of preschool-aged children adhered to the overall physical activity recommendation, 78% (95% CI = 38%, 95%) adhered to the TPA aspect of the recommendation, and 90% (95% CI = 81%, 95%) adhered to the MVPA aspect of the recommendation. There was substantial variability is prevalence estimates between different accelerometer cut-points. Girls were significantly less likely to achieve the overall recommendation and the MVPA aspect of the recommendation than boys were. Conclusions Although there was substantial variability in estimated prevalence of preschool-aged children adhering the WHO physical activity recommendation between various accelerometer cut-points, the weight of available evidence suggests that the majority of young children are adhering to the overall recommendation and the individual TPA and MVPA aspects of the recommendation. Large-scale, intercontinental surveillance studies are needed to further strengthen the evidence regarding the prevalence of preschool-aged children achieving physical activity recommendation globally.","2023-04-26","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","","","Physical Activity; Exercise; Physical Literacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranged from 0.78-0.96, but varied between IHD types, used methods and outcome measures. Only three out of eighteen did perform validation on an external dataset and most studies did not use explainable deep learning models. To be able to integrate AI as a tool to aid physicians in their diagnoses and clinical decisions within the IHD field, generalizability has to be better evaluated and explainability of DL models has to be increased.","2023-07-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","274-282","","5","33","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","Cardiac Surgery Risk Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these diagnoses are not perfect, and additional diagnostic tools (e.g., MRI) can help improve our understanding of AD as well as our ability to detect the disease. Accordingly, a large amount of research has been invested into innovative diagnostic methods for AD. Functional MRI (fMRI) is a form of neuroimaging technology that has been used to diagnose AD; however, fMRI is incredibly noisy, complex, and thus lacks clinical use. Nonetheless, recent innovations in deep learning technology could enable the simplified and streamlined analysis of fMRI. Deep learning is a form of artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms based on human neural networks to solve complex problems. For example, in fMRI research, deep learning models can automatically denoise images and classify AD by detecting patterns in participants' brain scans. In this systematic review, we investigate how fMRI (specifically resting-state fMRI) and deep learning methods are used to diagnose AD. In turn, we outline the common deep neural network, preprocessing, and classification methods used in the literature. We also discuss the accuracy, strengths, limitations, and future direction of fMRI deep learning methods. In turn, we aim to summarize the current field for new researchers, suggest specific areas for future research, and highlight the potential of fMRI to aid AD diagnoses.","2022-10-18","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","5-18","","1","33","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Wiley-Blackwell","","","","Functional MRI; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging Data Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Until now, it has mainly been described at a theoretical level and is associated with non-specific guidelines in LCA reference documents, thus leaving LCA practitioners with limited guidance prone to inefficient, not transparent, and sometimes inconsistent steps taken in the LCI phase. To tackle this problem, a stepwise data collection guidance is developed based on a critical review of existing guidelines and LCA case studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The guidance encompasses three steps: (i) planning of data collection, including the outlining of LCI blocks, which represent unit processes in an aggregation level that is technology-wise appropriate; (ii) data gathering using the LCI blocks; and (iii) LCI blocks finalization. A customizable, generic LCI template for data collection is provided to facilitate the conduct of steps (i)-(iii). A real-life data collection case of lithium-ion batteries manufacturing is used to demonstrate the guidance's applicability. LCI block datasets were produced using the customized LCI template and the proposed guidance. Cooperation with the case data provider thus enabled to fill the data collection template, which was then reviewed iteratively. Although this case evidences the guidance's operability and its benefits in facilitating and strengthening LCA practice, several constraints undermining reproducibility and transparency could be identified, in particular issues related to data confidentiality. Despite these limitations, which require further efforts from practitioners and more transparency from stakeholders involved in the commission of LCA studies, the authors call for applying the proposed stepwise guidance to enhance future LCA practice.","2022-09-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","132903-132903","","","366","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","Life Cycle Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work we investigated the scientific evidence on such mechanisms through a systematic mini-review of the literature about the relation of longevity and/or large body mass with physiological, genetic or environmental traits among mammalian species. More than forty thousand articles were retrieved from three repositories and 383 of them were screened using an active-learning-based tool. Of those, 36 articles on longevity and 37 on body mass were selected for the review. Such articles were examined focusing on: number and type of species considered, statistical methods used, traits investigated, and observed relationship with longevity and/or body mass. Where applicable, the traits investigated were matched with one or more hallmarks of cancer. We obtained a list of potential candidate traits to explain the Peto's paradox, related to replicative immortality, cells senescence, genome instability and mutations, proliferative signaling, growth suppression evasion and cells resistance to death. Our investigation suggests that different strategies have been followed to prevent cancer in large and long-lived species. The large number of papers retrieved emphasizes that more studies can be launched in the future, using more efficient analytical approaches, to comprehensively evaluate the convergent biological mechanisms essential for acquiring longevity and large body mass without increasing cancer risk.","2024-04-01","2023-08-24 13:27:47","2025-03-26 09:48:45","","100654-100654","","2","47","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Elsevier BV","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given the importance of such concept inventories for physics education research, and the challenges in developing them such as field testing with representative populations, this study seeks to examine to what extent a generative large language model could be utilized to generate a synthetic dataset for the FCI that exhibits content-related variability in responses. We use the recently introduced ChatGPT based on the GPT 4 generative large language model and investigate to what extent ChatGPT could solve the FCI accurately (RQ1) and could be prompted to solve the FCI as if it were a student belonging to a different cohort (RQ2). Furthermore, we study, to what extent ChatGPT could be prompted to solve the FCI as if it were a student having a different force- and mechanics-related preconception (RQ3). In alignment with other research, we found that ChatGPT could accurately solve the FCI. We furthermore found that prompting ChatGPT to respond to the inventory as if it belonged to a different cohort yielded no variance in responses, however, responding as if it had a certain preconception introduced much variance in responses that approximate real human responses on the FCI in some regards.Received 28 July 2023Accepted 3 October 2023DOI:https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevPhysEducRes.19.020150Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Journal of medical internet research/Journal of medical internet research","","1438-8871","10.2196/48168","https://doi.org/10.2196/48168","Background Conversational agents (CAs) or chatbots are computer programs that mimic human conversation. They have the potential to improve access to mental health interventions through automated, scalable, and personalized delivery of psychotherapeutic content. However, digital health interventions, including those delivered by CAs, often have high attrition rates. Identifying the factors associated with attrition is critical to improving future clinical trials. Objective This review aims to estimate the overall and differential rates of attrition in CA-delivered mental health interventions (CA interventions), evaluate the impact of study design and intervention-related aspects on attrition, and describe study design features aimed at reducing or mitigating study attrition. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science, and conducted a gray literature search on Google Scholar in June 2022. We included randomized controlled trials that compared CA interventions against control groups and excluded studies that lasted for 1 session only and used Wizard of Oz interventions. We also assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Random-effects proportional meta-analysis was applied to calculate the pooled dropout rates in the intervention groups. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to compare the attrition rate in the intervention groups with that in the control groups. We used a narrative review to summarize the findings. Results The systematic search retrieved 4566 records from peer-reviewed databases and citation searches, of which 41 (0.90%) randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analytic overall attrition rate in the intervention group was 21.84% (95% CI 16.74%-27.36%; I2=94%). Short-term studies that lasted ≤8 weeks showed a lower attrition rate (18.05%, 95% CI 9.91%- 27.76%; I2=94.6%) than long-term studies that lasted &gt;8 weeks (26.59%, 95% CI 20.09%-33.63%; I2=93.89%). Intervention group participants were more likely to attrit than control group participants for short-term (log odds ratio 1.22, 95% CI 0.99-1.50; I2=21.89%) and long-term studies (log odds ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.08-1.65; I2=49.43%). Intervention-related characteristics associated with higher attrition include stand-alone CA interventions without human support, not having a symptom tracker feature, no visual representation of the CA, and comparing CA interventions with waitlist controls. No participant-level factor reliably predicted attrition. Conclusions Our results indicated that approximately one-fifth of the participants will drop out from CA interventions in short-term studies. High heterogeneities made it difficult to generalize the findings. Our results suggested that future CA interventions should adopt a blended design with human support, use symptom tracking, compare CA intervention groups against active controls rather than waitlist controls, and include a visual representation of the CA to reduce the attrition rate.

The characteristics of blockchain have made it a promising technology to transform many activities related to public policy and public service provision, such as administrative processes, welfare provision and regulation practices. This article provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic literature review of the use of blockchain across all the main public services. This systematic review identifies the public services most likely to be impacted by the introduction of blockchain. It also highlights the main potential benefits, costs and risks of blockchain for government, civil servants and citizens. Governments are found to benefit mainly from improvements in efficiency and traceability, while regulatory uncertainty and questions around scalability represent major costs and risks for them. Civil servants, the least studied actor in the literature, could benefit from blockchain through the reduction of red tape and improvements in coordination between agencies. Their lack of blockchain knowledge and skills represent a major cost as regards adoption. Regarding citizens, security and transparency are identified as being the most important benefits, while risks are mainly associated with data security concerns. The article concludes by noting several limitations in the literature and providing suggestions towards fruitful lines of research.","2021-01-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","13904-13921","","","9","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers","","","","Blockchain","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on experimental studies providing comparable findings from controlled settings to facilitate an empirically grounded understanding of climate policy synergies. Our analysis reveals negative synergy effects, indicating that, on average, the analyzed policy mixes are less effective than the sum of their individual intervention effects. However, we also find that policy mixes can offset the negative effects of single policies. Notably, combinations involving nudges and monetary incentives prove particularly effective in promoting pro-environmental behavior. Lastly, behavioral changes induced by policy mixes tend to wane faster compared to single interventions once the policies are removed.

In this systematic review, we map out factors affecting employers' hiring decisions about people with disabilities.This study is a systematic review that applies the COM-B model to identify factors that contribute to employers (not) hiring people with disabilities. The COM-B model proposes that employers will perform hiring behavior (B) if they have the capability (C), opportunity (O) and motivation (M) to do so. We also investigate if factors have a negative, positive or no effect. We report in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines.In a review of 47 studies, we find 32 factors. Most of these factors are barriers. The most frequently mentioned barriers are employers' (1) expectations that people with disabilities are unproductive, (2) expectations that people with disabilities cost a lot of money, and employers' (3) lack of knowledge about disabilities. The most researched facilitators for employers to hire people with disabilities include (1) the motivation to help others, (2) working in a large organization, and (3) expecting a competitive advantage. The effect of factors can differ depending on contextual circumstances, including the type of organization, the type of disability and different policies.We conclude that hiring decisions are influenced by an array of different barriers and facilitators.

Results revealed that theoretical frameworks have been established more strongly in the parent literature and parental behaviors have been more extensively studied with more diverse terms compared to studies in teacher literature. Overall, patterns of findings suggest that positive (e.g., emotional support) and cognitive parental/teacher behaviors (e.g., cognitive stimulation) were positively linked to child EF performance while negative behaviors (e.g., intrusiveness) were adversely related. Considering the similar roles of parents and teachers in child EF development, insights from parent literature could enable a better understanding of the impact of teacher behaviors on child EF (and vice versa), and opens new venues for future teacher research.

To accelerate this process, various tools that utilize active learning have been proposed. These tools allow the reviewer to interact with machine learning software to identify relevant publications as early as possible. The goal of this study is to gain a comprehensive understanding of active learning models for reducing the workload in systematic reviews through a simulation study.The simulation study mimics the process of a human reviewer screening records while interacting with an active learning model. Different active learning models were compared based on four classification techniques (naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, and random forest) and two feature extraction strategies (TF-IDF and doc2vec). The performance of the models was compared for six systematic review datasets from different research areas. The evaluation of the models was based on the Work Saved over Sampling (WSS) and recall. Additionally, this study introduces two new statistics, Time to Discovery (TD) and Average Time to Discovery (ATD).The models reduce the number of publications needed to screen by 91.7 to 63.9% while still finding 95% of all relevant records (WSS@95). Recall of the models was defined as the proportion of relevant records found after screening 10% of of all records and ranges from 53.6 to 99.8%. The ATD values range from 1.4% till 11.7%, which indicate the average proportion of labeling decisions the researcher needs to make to detect a relevant record. The ATD values display a similar ranking across the simulations as the recall and WSS values.Active learning models for screening prioritization demonstrate significant potential for reducing the workload in systematic reviews. The Naive Bayes + TF-IDF model yielded the best results overall. The Average Time to Discovery (ATD) measures performance of active learning models throughout the entire screening process without the need for an arbitrary cut-off point. This makes the ATD a promising metric for comparing the performance of different models across different datasets.","2023-06-20","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: BioMed Central","","","","Active Learning; Meta-Learning; Robust Learning; Semi-Supervised Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In our era of accelerated accumulation of knowledge, the manual screening of literature for eligibility is increasingly becoming too labor-intensive for summarizing the current state of knowledge in a timely manner. Recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing promise to reduce the screening workload by automatically detecting unseen references with a high probability of inclusion. As a variety of tools have been developed, the current review provides an overview of their characteristics and performance. A systematic search in various databases yielded 488 eligible reports, revealing 15 tools for screening automation that differed in methodology, features, and accessibility. For the review on the performance of screening tools, 21 studies could be included. In comparison to sampling records randomly, active screening with prioritization approximately halves the screening workload. However, a comparison of tools under equal or at least similar conditions is needed to derive clear recommendations.","2023-02-01","2023-04-17 08:21:53","2025-03-13 15:03:04","","3-15","","1","231","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: Johann Ambrosius Barth Verlag","","","","Information Retrieval; Machine Translation; Natural Language Processing; peer_reviewed_article; tool_comparison","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An electronic search of nine data bases was conducted from the inception of the databases until 1st October 2021. Disordered eating was defined as the percentage of students scoring at or above established cut-offs on validated screening measures. Global data were also analyzed by country, research measure, and culture. Other confounders in this review were age, BMI, and sex. Using random-effects meta-analysis, the mean estimate of the distribution of effects for the prevalence of SBDE among university students (K = 105, N = 145,629) was [95% CI] = 19.7% [17.9%; 21.6%], I2 = 98.2%, Cochran's Q p value = 0.001. Bayesian meta-analysis produced an estimate of 0.24, 95% credible intervals [0.20, 0.30], τ = 92%. Whether the country in which the students were studying was Western or non-Western did not moderate these effects, but as either the mean BMI of the sample or the percentage of the sample that was female increased, the prevalence of SBDE increased. These findings support previous studies indicating that many undergraduate students are struggling with disordered eating or a diagnosable eating disorder, but are neither receiver effective prevention nor accessing accurate diagnosis and available treatment. It is particularly important to develop ever more valid ways of identifying students with high levels of disordered eating and offering them original or culturally appropriate and effective prevention or early treatment.

We searched 13 databases as of December 2022 for studies reporting both the pre- and peri-pandemic prevalence of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, or rate of death by suicide. A random-effects model was used to pool the ratio of peri- and pre-pandemic prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt (Prevalence Ratio-PR) and rate of death by suicide (Rate Ratio; RR). We identified 51, 55, and 25 samples for suicidal ideation, attempt, and death by suicide. The prevalence of suicidal ideation increased significantly among non-clinical (PR = 1.142; 95% CI: 1.018-1.282; p = 0.024; k = 28) and clinical (PR = 1.134; 95% CI: 1.048-1.227; p = 0.002; k = 23) samples, and pooled estimates differed by population and study design. Suicide attempts were more prevalent during the pandemic among non-clinical (PR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.053-1.233; p = 0.001; k = 30) and clinical (PR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.17-1.489; p = 0.000; k = 25) participants. The pooled RR for death by suicide was 0.923 (95% CI: 0.84-1.01; p = 0.092; k = 25), indicating a nonsignificant downward trend. An upward trend of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts was observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite suicide rate remaining stable.

However, due to the increasing medical-scientific research output, it is a time-consuming task to conduct systematic reviews. To accelerate this process, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in the review process. In this communication paper, we suggest how to conduct a transparent and reliable systematic review using the AI tool 'ASReview' in the title and abstract screening.Use of the AI tool consisted of several steps. First, the tool required training of its algorithm with several prelabelled articles prior to screening. Next, using a researcher-in-the-loop algorithm, the AI tool proposed the article with the highest probability of being relevant. The reviewer then decided on relevancy of each article proposed. This process was continued until the stopping criterion was reached. All articles labelled relevant by the reviewer were screened on full text.Considerations to ensure methodological quality when using AI in systematic reviews included: the choice of whether to use AI, the need of both deduplication and checking for inter-reviewer agreement, how to choose a stopping criterion and the quality of reporting. Using the tool in our review resulted in much time saved: only 23% of the articles were assessed by the reviewer.The AI tool is a promising innovation for the current systematic reviewing practice, as long as it is appropriately used and methodological quality can be assured.CRD42022283952.","2023-07-01","2024-06-05 08:33:19","2024-06-05 08:33:19","","e072254-e072254","","7","13","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","Publisher: BMJ","","","","Artificial Intelligences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional methods rely heavily on human reviewers, often requiring a significant investment of time and resources.This study aims to assess the performance of the OpenAI generative pretrained transformer (GPT) and GPT-4 application programming interfaces (APIs) in accurately and efficiently identifying relevant titles and abstracts from real-world clinical review data sets and comparing their performance against ground truth labeling by 2 independent human reviewers.We introduce a novel workflow using the Chat GPT and GPT-4 APIs for screening titles and abstracts in clinical reviews. A Python script was created to make calls to the API with the screening criteria in natural language and a corpus of title and abstract data sets filtered by a minimum of 2 human reviewers. We compared the performance of our model against human-reviewed papers across 6 review papers, screening over 24,000 titles and abstracts.Our results show an accuracy of 0.91, a macro F1-score of 0.60, a sensitivity of excluded papers of 0.91, and a sensitivity of included papers of 0.76. The interrater variability between 2 independent human screeners was κ=0.46, and the prevalence and bias-adjusted κ between our proposed methods and the consensus-based human decisions was κ=0.96. On a randomly selected subset of papers, the GPT models demonstrated the ability to provide reasoning for their decisions and corrected their initial decisions upon being asked to explain their reasoning for incorrect classifications.Large language models have the potential to streamline the clinical review process, save valuable time and effort for researchers, and contribute to the overall quality of clinical reviews.

Despite the importance of establishing causal relationships, it remains unclear how much suicide prevention literature focuses on causal research and utilizes appropriate methods for causal inference.                                   OBJECTIVE             Present a protocol for a scoping review that aims to identify and characterize the use of modern causal inference methods in observational suicide prevention research by describing their relative frequency of application across suicide outcomes, exposures, interventions, populations, and other study characteristics. Our plan includes evaluating how closely investigators' methods align with any causal interpretations, and whether the degree of alignment varies by discipline. The findings will elucidate these methodological trends and their implications, helping to shape future suicide prevention research strategies.                                   METHODS             The protocol design is based on the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) framework for scoping reviews, and final reporting will adhere to the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We will search the PubMed, Embase, ProQuest, and Web of Science databases for peer-reviewed literature and academic dissertations. Eligible studies must include adult populations (18 and older), suicide attempts or deaths, and use modern causal inference methods in observational research designs. Following a rigorous search strategy, two independent reviewers will be involved in the study selection, data extraction, and evidence analysis using ASReview software for title and abstract screening and Covidence for full-text screening and data extraction.                                   RESULTS             The scoping review is currently underway, with the search strategy developed and preliminary search results obtained. Data collection, extraction, and analysis are expected to be completed in the upcoming months, with results anticipated to be published in 2024. The results will be presented using a PRISMA-ScR flow diagram, narrative summaries, and various visualizations, such as heatmaps and ridge plots, to provide a comprehensive overview of the extracted data.                                   CONCLUSIONS             This scoping review will provide an overview of the application of modern causal inference methods in observational suicide research, highlighting gaps and trends in their use across different study contexts (e.g., disciplines, study designs, outcomes).

With the advent of machine learning, there is an opportunity to accelerate the review process in study screening. We aimed to understand the literature to make decisions about the use of machine learning for screening in our review workflow.                                         Methods               A pragmatic literature review of PubMed to obtain studies evaluating the accuracy of publicly available machine learning screening tools. A single reviewer used ‘snowballing’ searches to identify studies reporting accuracy data and extracted the sensitivity (ability to correctly identify included studies for a review) and specificity, or workload saved (ability to correctly exclude irrelevant studies).                                         Results               Ten tools (AbstractR, ASReview Lab, Cochrane RCT classifier, Concept encoder, Dpedia, DistillerAI, Rayyan, Research Screener, Robot Analyst, SWIFT-active screener) were evaluated in a total of 16 studies. Fourteen studies were single arm where, although compared with a reference standard (predominantly single reviewer screening), there was no other comparator. Two studies were comparative, where tools were compared with other tools as well as a reference standard. All tools ranked records by probability of inclusion and either (i) applied a cut-point to exclude records or (ii) were used to rank and re-rank records during screening iterations, with screening continuing until most relevant records were obtained. The accuracy of tools varied widely between different studies and review projects. When used in method (ii), at 95 percent to 100 percent sensitivity, tools achieved workload savings of between 7 percent and 99 percent. It was unclear whether evaluations were conducted independent of tool developers.                                         Conclusions               Evaluations suggest the potential for tools to correctly classify studies in screening. However, conclusions are limited since (i) tool accuracy is generally not compared with dual reviewer screening and (ii) the literature lacks comparative studies and, because of between-study heterogeneity, it is not possible to robustly determine the accuracy of tools compared with each other. Independent evaluations are needed.","2023-12","2024-09-05 21:21:15","2024-12-11 15:01:52","2024-09-05 21:21:15","S67-S67","","S1","39","","Int J Technol Assess Health Care","","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The quality of a systematic review depends critically on having comprehensively surveyed all relevant literature on the review topic. In addition to database searching, handsearching is an important supplementary technique that helps increase the likelihood of identifying all relevant studies in a literature search. Traditional handsearching requires reviewers to manually browse through a curated list of field‐specific journals and conference proceedings to find articles relevant to the review topic. This manual process is not only time‐consuming, laborious, costly, and error‐prone due to human fatigue, but it also lacks replicability due to its cumbersome manual nature. To address these issues, this paper presents a free and open‐source Python package and an accompanying web‐app,               Paperfetcher               , to automate the retrieval of article metadata for handsearching. With               Paperfetcher               's assistance, researchers can retrieve article metadata from designated journals within a specified time frame in just a few clicks. In addition to handsearching, it also incorporates a beta version of citation searching in both forward and backward directions.               Paperfetcher               has an easy‐to‐use interface, which allows researchers to download the metadata of retrieved studies as a list of DOIs or as an RIS file to facilitate seamless import into systematic review screening software. To the best of our knowledge,               Paperfetcher               is the first tool to automate handsearching with high usability and a multi‐disciplinary focus.","2022-10-19","2022-11-14 15:07:10","2025-03-13 15:02:06","2024-09-05 21:37:10","323-335","","2","14","","Research Synthesis Methods","<span style=""font-variant","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","uitzoeken; systematic_review_support_tools","/unread","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, this systematic review summarizes results from human intervention studies of altered sleep timing on glycaemic outcomes.                                         Materials and Methods               As part of a broader search on the effect of altering timing of sleep, physical activity and dietary intake, Medline and Embase were searched from inception to February 2023, and subsequent reference searches were done. With the help of a machine learning–aided program ‘ASReview’, we selected any type of intervention study in the general adult population, which acutely delayed sleep by ≥2 h for at least one night, while the total time in bed was the same between early and late sleep. Quality assessment was done using the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies.                                         Results                                In total, 14 studies (159 adults with normal or increased weight) were identified.

Acute delays of sleep onset showed unfavourable effects in 10 out of 27 measured glycaemic outcomes (one–six studies reported on each outcome) with outcomes mostly measured in the postprandial period, compared to (early) nighttime sleep.                                                        Conclusions               Acutely delaying sleep timing might have unfavourable effects on glycaemic outcomes, compared to (early) nighttime sleep.

Mobile health interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting PA. Personalizing persuasive strategies improves intervention success and can be conducted using machine learning (ML). For PA, several studies have addressed personalized persuasive strategies without ML, whereas others have included personalization using ML without focusing on persuasive strategies. An overview of studies discussing ML to personalize persuasive strategies in PA-promoting interventions and corresponding categorizations could be helpful for such interventions to be designed in the future but is still missing.                                         Objective               First, we aimed to provide an overview of implemented ML techniques to personalize persuasive strategies in mobile health interventions promoting PA. Moreover, we aimed to present a categorization overview as a starting point for applying ML techniques in this field.                                         Methods               A scoping review was conducted based on the framework by Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) criteria. Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched for studies that included ML to personalize persuasive strategies in interventions promoting PA. Papers were screened using the ASReview software. From the included papers, categorized by the research project they belonged to, we extracted data regarding general study information, target group, PA intervention, implemented technology, and study details. On the basis of the analysis of these data, a categorization overview was given.                                         Results               In total, 40 papers belonging to 27 different projects were included. These papers could be categorized in 4 groups based on their dimension of personalization. Then, for each dimension, 1 or 2 persuasive strategy categories were found together with a type of ML. The overview resulted in a categorization consisting of 3 levels: dimension of personalization, persuasive strategy, and type of ML. When personalizing the timing of the messages, most projects implemented reinforcement learning to personalize the timing of reminders and supervised learning (SL) to personalize the timing of feedback, monitoring, and goal-setting messages. Regarding the content of the messages, most projects implemented SL to personalize PA suggestions and feedback or educational messages. For personalizing PA suggestions, SL can be implemented either alone or combined with a recommender system. Finally, reinforcement learning was mostly used to personalize the type of feedback messages.                                         Conclusions               The overview of all implemented persuasive strategies and their corresponding ML methods is insightful for this interdisciplinary field. Moreover, it led to a categorization overview that provides insights into the design and development of personalized persuasive strategies to promote PA. In future papers, the categorization overview might be expanded with additional layers to specify ML methods or additional dimensions of personalization and persuasive strategies.","2024-11-15","2024-12-11 12:40:09","2025-02-28 15:33:17","2024-12-11 12:40:09","e47774","","","26","","J Med Internet Res","Machine Learning Methods to Personalize Persuasive Strategies in mHealth Interventions That Promote Physical Activity","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The methodology describes the data collection procedure using the ASReview Lab system. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. The review we present includes a descriptive analysis of the data. The search strategy included searching abstracts of relevant studies. Automatic random selection was used to identify eligible studies. Abstracts were categorized as relevant or irrelevant according to the keywords entered. The selection process continued until a stopping criterion was reached.  ResultsIn the study, we primarily focused on the age and gender of the participants, protective and risk factors as well as the consequences in connection with the investigated issue. Consequences included low self-esteem, negative feelings related to one's body image, anxiety, depression, shame, comparison, perfectionism about physical appearance, editing photos before sharing on social networks, etc. We perceive a correlation with individual consequences and interventions. Striving for positive changes and interventions can be considered as a direct response to the negative consequences mentioned above, such as body shame, low self-esteem, negative body perception, etc. Interventions discuss positive results in self-compassion, which is directly related to body shaming and body-esteem from previous consequences. Similarly, interventions with positive effects on body image are related to several already mentioned consequences, such as worse body image, dissatisfaction with appearance and negative perception of one's own body. Conclusions: The findings suggest an equally high need for prevention strategies and educational interventions that promote media literacy and critical thinking skills for safer interactions in the online space among adolescents and young adults. We believe that our study will be an inspiration for further research, either by supplementing the systematic review with additional studies or empirical interventions in the form of prevention or interventions in connection with the examined issue of physical appearance and online space.","2024-11-12","2024-12-11 12:40:49","2025-02-28 15:35:51","2024-12-11 12:40:49","","","8","3","","JoE","Body Shaming in Online Space","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particularly in older adults, it can affect gait performance. Due to a wide variety in fatiguing protocols and gait parameters used in experimental settings, pooled effects are not yet clear. Furthermore, specific elements of fatiguing protocols (i.e., intensity, duration, and type of activity) might lead to different changes in gait parameters. We aimed to systematically quantify to what extent exercise-induced fatigue alters gait in community-dwelling older adults, and whether specific elements of fatiguing protocols could be identified.Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. In September 2022 and April 2023, we searched through PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane and CINAHL databases. Two independent researchers screened and assessed articles using ASReview, Rayyan, and ROBINS-I. We extracted data related to spatiotemporal, stability, and variability gait parameters of healthy older adults (55+) before and after a fatiguing protocol or prolonged physical exercise. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed on both absolute and non-absolute effect sizes in RStudio. Moderator analyses were performed on six clusters of gait parameters (Dynamic Balance, Lower Limb Kinematics, Regularity, Spatio-temporal Parameters, Symmetry, Velocity). Results: We included 573 effect sizes on gait parameters from 31 studies. The included studies reflected a total population of 761 older adults (57% female), with a mean age of 71 (SD 3) years. Meta-analysis indicated that exercise-induced fatigue affected gait with a standardized mean change of 0.31 (p&lt;.001). Moderator analyses showed no statistical differences between the different clusters. Within clusters, the effects were non-uniform, resulting in an overall effect that was indistinguishable from zero. The fatiguing protocols’ duration, intensity, or type of activity did not moderate effects.Discussion:  Due to the (mainly) low GRADE certainty scores as a result of the heterogeneity between studies, and possible different strategies to cope with fatigue between participants, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that older adults, therapist, and researchers should be aware of the small to moderate changes in gait parameters as a result of exercise-induced fatigue. No changes in specific clusters, nor important elements of fatiguing protocols were identified.","2024-10-28","2024-12-11 12:42:56","2025-02-28 15:47:35","2024-12-11 12:42:56","","","","","","","Exercise-induced muscle fatigue leads to changes in gait-related parameters among older adults","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","","","","Open Science Framework","","","","","","systematic_review; meta_analysis; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although sleep disturbances are implicated in psychopathology of eating disorders, its role in anorexia nervosa (AN) remains unclear. This review aimed to characterise sleep in AN.                                         Methods               A systematic search was conducted in four scientific databases, including papers from inception to 25 May 2024. A machine learning algorithm (ASReview) was utilised to screen titles and abstracts for eligibility. Sleep quantity, architecture, and quality were investigated. Meta‐analyses were conducted to investigate the difference between patients with AN and healthy controls (HC) in total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency, Sleep Stage 1, 2, slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and REM latency. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.                                         Results               Out of 67 potentially eligible papers, 31 were included in this review, with 15 in the meta‐analyses. Statistically significant average mean differences were found for TST (−32.1 min [95% CI: −50.9, −13.4]), WASO (19.0 min [95% CI: −2.4, 40.3]), and sleep efficiency (−4.4% [95% CI: −7.9, −0.9]). Additionally, Sleep stage 1 was significantly increased (2.4% [95%‐CI: 0.05, 4.7]), while REM sleep was reduced (−2.1% [95%‐CI: −4.2, −0.02]). Subgroup analysis showed that TST and WASO did not improve significantly after weight restoration.                                         Conclusion               Sleep in patients with AN is impaired, with lower TST and sleep efficiency, higher WASO, more time in stage 1 sleep, and less in REM. Weight restoration alone may not improve sleep. While more research is needed, substantial accompanying sleep disturbances in AN justifies addressing these in current treatment practice, also because of the chronic character of AN and importance of sleep for long term (mental) health.                        ,              Highlights                                                                Patients with anorexia nervosa experience longer periods of wakefulness during the night, along with lower total sleep time and sleep efficiency compared to healthy controls.                                                     Patients with anorexia nervosa spend more time in stage 1 sleep and less time in rapid eye movement sleep compared to healthy controls.

The objective of this study is to enhance our understanding of additional determinants affecting migrants' health by examining the impact of the migration phase and related journeys in the European context.                                         Methods               We conducted a systematic review of studies published in the MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus databases from 2003 up to January 5, 2024. We included observational studies reporting information on the health status of migrant populations recorded upon arrival in a country situated in Europe, and on the transit phase, including specific risk factors experienced during the journey or its characteristics. Title and abstract screening were performed using active learning techniques provided by ASReview software. The results of the included studies were presented qualitatively, with a focus on publications that formally assessed the association between the journey and the investigated health outcomes.

With the growing number of scientific publications, the SR development process becomes even more laborious. This is problematic because timely SR evidence is essential for decision-making in evidence-based healthcare and policymaking. Numerous methods and tools that accelerate SR development have recently emerged.  To date, no scoping review has been conducted to provide a comprehensive summary of methods and ready-to-use tools to improve efficiency in SR production. Objective   To present an overview of primary studies that evaluated the use of ready-to-use applications of tools or review methods to improve efficiency in the review process. Methods   We conducted a scoping review. An information specialist performed a systematic literature search in four databases, supplemented with citation-based and grey literature searching. We included studies reporting the performance of methods and ready-to-use tools for improving efficiency when producing or updating a SR in the health field. We performed dual, independent title and abstract screening, full-text selection, and data extraction. The results were analyzed descriptively and presented narratively. Results  We included 103 studies: 51 studies reported on methods, 54 studies on tools, and 2 studies reported on both methods and tools to make SR production more efficient. A total of 72 studies evaluated the validity (n = 69) or usability (n = 3) of one method (n = 33) or tool (n = 39), and 31 studies performed comparative analyses of different methods (n = 15) or tools (n = 16). 20 studies conducted prospective evaluations in real-time workflows. Most studies evaluated methods or tools that aimed at screening titles and abstracts (n = 42) and literature searching (n = 24), while for other steps of the SR process, only a few studies were found. Regarding the outcomes included, most studies reported on validity outcomes (n = 84), while outcomes such as impact on results (n = 23), time-saving (n = 26), usability (n = 13), and cost-saving (n = 3) were less often evaluated. Conclusion  For title and abstract screening and literature searching, various evaluated methods and tools are available that aim at improving the efficiency of SR production. However, only few studies have addressed the influence of these methods and tools in real-world workflows. Few studies exist that evaluate methods or tools supporting the remaining tasks.

However, the inherently rigorous and structured nature of the SR process renders it laborious for human reviewers. Moreover, the exponential growth in daily published literature exacerbates the challenge, as SRs risk missing out on incorporating recent studies that could potentially influence research outcomes. This pressing need to streamline and enhance the efficiency of SRs has prompted significant interest in leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to automate various stages of the SR process. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current AI methods employed for SR automation, a subject area that has not been exhaustively covered in previous literature. Through an extensive analysis of 52 related works and an original online survey, the primary AI techniques and their applications in automating key SR stages, such as search, screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment, are identified. The survey results offer practical insights into the current practices, experiences, opinions, and expectations of SR practitioners and researchers regarding future SR automation. Synthesis of the literature review and survey findings highlights gaps and challenges in the current landscape of SR automation using AI techniques. Based on these insights, potential future directions are discussed.

Today, in the emerging field of Generative AI tools based on Large Language Models, there has been rapid development of new literature search tools and approaches. This study has the aim of exploring this vast array of Generative AI tools, in a literature study where some of the found tools were used to facilitate the selection of relevant publication. Three research questions guided this study: RQ1) ""What Generative AI tools can be found in literature?"", RQ2) ""Which of these tools could be of use in the literature review conducted in this study, and how?"", and RQ3) ""What are the ethical aspects of using Generative AI tools in literature studies?” The approach has been a scoping review, built around a search that combined the keywords: ""AI supported"", ""AI generated"", ""AI based"" and ""Literature review"". An initial result set was filtered with inclusion exclusion criteria in a strive for an interesting quality answer to the research questions. However, most publications that passed the filtering lacked any potential to contribute to answer the research questions. The most interesting finding in the first search was a hint about the new feature 'Scopus AI'. A new search with the Scopus AI tool resulted in a small but very relevant set of publications. These publications were analysed in a deductive inductive thematic analysis, and primary sorted into the categories of: 'Generative AI Tools', 'Supportive AI Techniques', and 'Ethical Issues'. Findings indicate that there is a wide variety of tools that can facilitate the skimming process of a literature, and to provide adequate summaries of retrieved publication. However, authors recommendation is to keep the tools on the facilitating support level, and that the main analysis and conclusion should be human conducted.

Long-term use is associated with side-effects and patients often lack a valid indication. Inappropriate PPI prescribing thus needs to be addressed. This review aims to scope 1) what determinants are studied as reasons for PPI prescribing, 2) what strategies are used for changing PPI (de)prescribing, and 3) whether important determinants are addressed in these interventions.                                         Methods               We searched eight databases for papers on determinants of physician PPI prescribing.

There is a need to use and evaluate automated strategies to accelerate systematic reviews in education. Here, we comprehensively tested classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning model families. We also assessed the performance of prompt engineering via few-shot learning of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 large language models. We further attempted to understand when ML models can help automate screening. These ML models were applied to actual datasets of systematic reviews in education. Results showed that the performance of classical and deep ML models varied widely across datasets, ranging from 1.2% to 75.6% of work saved at 95% recall. LLM prompt engineering produced similarly wide performance variation. We searched for various indicators of whether and how ML screening can help. We discovered that the separability of clusters of relevant versus irrelevant articles in high-dimensional embedding space can strongly predict whether ML screening can help (overall R = 0.81). This simple and generalizable heuristic applied well across datasets and different ML model families. In conclusion, ML screening performance varies tremendously but researchers can consider using our embedding heuristic in various ways to aid ML screening efforts.","2024-05-21","2024-09-05 11:54:50","2025-03-26 09:10:37","2024-12-11 14:12:27","","","","","","","Can machine learning help accelerate article screening for systematic reviews?","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/legalcode","","","","EdArXiv","","","","","","stefano_checked; systematic_review_methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The use of chatbots for mental health is now frequently discussed as a means to increase access to mental health resources. For this scoping review of reviews on chatbots for mental health, we performed a systematic search of the literature on Scopus, Web of Science, Pubmed and Dimensions.ai and identified 14 relevant reviews published in scientific journals which identified publications following a systematic search on two or more databases. Three additional relevant reviews were included following forward and backward reference examination. The 17 included reviews are: eight systematic reviews (three with meta-analysis), seven scoping reviews and two unlabeled reviews. We have summarized the scope of the reviews as well as their findings. Most reviews included at least one study with 15 participants or less. Few reviews report an important proportion of RCTs and some original publications most of the time report on piloting studies. Overall, the reviews examined the opinions of users of chatbots (generally good user’s perceptions although some find deterrents), the features of chatbots, the outcomes and measures in studies relying on chatbots, the effectiveness of chatbots (particularly the meta-analyses) for the alleviation of mental disorder symptomatology (three meta-analyses find effectiveness for depression, whereas other clinical targets might need further research) as well as their potential for the assessment of mental health. The use of machine learning and natural language processing frameworks (Dialogflow, RASA) seems to drive an increasing number of studies of chatbots for mental health. Overall, we conclude that there is potential for the use of chatbots for mental health, but that progress is necessary in following areas affecting interaction dynamics: reduction of the frequent lack of empathy and repetitiveness, inclusion of user assessment within the chatbot system, inclusion of a memory of past interactions. Large language models might be capable of reducing part of these issues and playing an increasingly important role in the field. Whether data privacy can be guaranteed to users is also an important question, which seems to be overlooked in the field.","2024-03-20","2024-12-11 14:15:59","2025-03-26 09:49:57","2024-12-11 14:15:59","","","","","","","Chatbots and mental health","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode","","","","PsyArXiv","","","","","","stefano_checked; scoping_review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of how HL is conceptualized and described in the context of health promotion in 9–12-year-old children.                                         Methods               A systematic and comprehensive search for ‘health literacy’ and ‘children’ and ‘measure’ was performed in accordance with PRISMA ScR in PubMed, Embase.com and via Ebsco in CINAHL, APA PsycInfo and ERIC. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and evaluated full-text publications regarding eligibility. Data was extracted systematically, and the extracted descriptions of HL were analyzed qualitatively using deductive analysis based on previously published HL definitions.                                         Results               The search provided 5,401 original titles, of which 26 eligible publications were included. We found a wide variation of descriptions of learning outcomes as well as competencies for HL. Most HL descriptions could be linked to commonly used definitions of HL in the literature, and some combined several HL dimensions. The descriptions varied between HL dimensions and were not always relevant to health promotion. The educational setting plays a prominent role in HL regarding health promotion.                                         Conclusion               The description of HL is truly diverse and complex encompassing a wide range of topics.

This systematic literature review presents a comprehensive analysis of the literature to uncover the reasons behind dropout rates in virtual learning environments. Following the PRISMA guidelines, this study systematically identifies and elucidates the risk factors associated with dropout in online higher education. The selection process encompassed articles published between 2013 and June 2023, resulting in the inclusion of 110 relevant articles that significantly contribute to the discourse in this field. We examine demographic, course-related, technology-related, motivational, and support-related aspects that shape students’ decisions in online learning programs. The review highlights key contributors to dropout like the quality of the course, academic preparation, student satisfaction, learner motivation, system attributes, and support services. Conversely, health concerns, financial limitations, technological issues, screen fatigue, isolation, and academic workload, emerge as significant limitations reported by online learners. These insights offer a holistic understanding of dropout dynamics, guiding the development of targeted interventions and strategies to enhance the quality and effectiveness of online education.","2024-03-12","2024-12-11 14:16:28","2025-03-26 09:50:18","2024-12-11 14:16:28","19","","1","21","","Int J Educ Technol High Educ","Dropout in online higher education","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At present, climate anxiety is not operationalized consistently across the existing literature. It is important to gain more consensus on the definition and operationalization of climate anxiety to facilitate reliable and generalizable research and to further develop interventions. Content analysis can contribute to this by providing insight into the overlap in the content of climate anxiety measures. With a systematic search, this study identified and analyzed 12 distinct scales measuring climate anxiety. The 119 items covered a total of 57 disparate symptoms. Jaccard indices showed that the mean overlap between symptoms of different climate anxiety scales was generally very low, as was the overlap between pairwise comparisons of climate anxiety scales. These results highlight the lack of uniformity in assessing climate anxiety and the need to properly define and operationalize this concept. The potential reasons for low overlap and how this might impact the reliability and validity of existing measures is discussed.

Articles published until 12 December 2023 were explored using EconLit, EMBASE and PubMed. We focused on critical or high-priority bacteria, as defined by the WHO, and intervention costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis guidelines, we extracted unit costs, ICERs and essential study information including country, intervention, bacteria-drug combination, discount rates, type of model and outcomes. Costs were reported in 2022 US dollars ($), adopting the healthcare system perspective. Country willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds from Woods                 et al                 2016 guided cost-effectiveness assessments.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as hygiene measures, had unit costs as low as $1 per patient, contrasting with generally higher pharmaceutical intervention costs. Several studies found that linezolid-based treatments for methicillin-resistant                 Staphylococcus aureus                 were cost-effective compared with vancomycin (ICER up to $21 488 per treatment success, all 16 studies’ ICERs<WTP). Infection control measures such as hand hygiene and gown usage (ICER=$1160/QALY or $4949 per ABR case averted, all ICERs<WTP) and PCR or chromogenic agar screening for ABR detection were highly cost-effective (eg, ICER=$1206 and $1115 per life-year saved in Europe and the USA).

In particular, semi-automated tools can start with a small set of seed articles and actively learn from human screening decisions before prioritising more relevant articles for screening. However, these tools could suffer from biases and indeterminate stopping criteria. Furthermore, their performance is unclear in large-scale systematic reviews that examine broad domains of interest. In this article, we reported on a hybrid screening approach that integrates text-mining techniques and a semi-automated tool to efficiently reduce, screen, and validate a large cohort of articles (N=86,228) during preliminary screening. We demonstrated the possibility of using a semi-automated tool as a second virtual reviewer while improving the efficiency of the overall process. We highlighted the strengths and limitations of using a semi-automated tool alone in a large-scale systematic review.

Hyperscanning enables the simultaneous recording of physiological signals from multiple participants. We highlight the trend towards integrating Mobile Brain/Body Imaging (MoBI) within the 4E research framework, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of brain, body, and environment in cognitive processes. Our analysis reveals a geographic concentration of hyperscanning studies in the Global North, indicating a disparity in neuroscience research distribution. This calls for global collaboration and transcultural research to balance the field. The predominant use of Electroencephalogram (EEG) in these studies suggests a traditional brain-centric perspective in social neuroscience. Future research directions should focus on integrating diverse techniques to capture the dynamic interplay between brain and body functions in real-world contexts. Our review also finds a preference for tasks involving real social interactions, aligning with the aims of social neuroscience to comprehend social behavior in natural settings. Nevertheless, the analysis in hyperscanning studies is often limited to physiological signal synchrony between participants. This suggests a need for more holistic and complex approaches that combine inter-corporeal synchrony with intra-individual measures.In conclusion, embodied hyperscanning represents a cutting-edge methodology, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the complex interactions between the brain, body, the environment, and social behavior. Overcoming geographic and methodological constraints will enable a more nuanced and inclusive comprehension of cognitive processes. The future of the neuroscience of relationships lies in embracing the complexity of cognition, integrating diverse methods and theories to enrich our grasp of human social behavior in its natural context.","2024-01-24","2024-12-11 14:19:06","2025-03-26 10:39:00","2024-12-11 14:19:06","","","","","","","Embodied Hyperscanning for studying social interaction","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","","","","PsyArXiv","","","","","","stefano_checked; scoping_review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Numerous industrial processes incorporate hydrogen in their transformation towards climate neutrality. To date, the high cost of producing hydrogen from renewable sources has been a major barrier to its widespread adoption. Inspired by these two aspects, many researchers have published cost predictions for hydrogen. This review provides an overview of the extant literature of more than 7000 publications in the last two decades concerned with the topic. After removing articles that do not provide explicit hydrogen production cost projections for the 2020 to 2050 time horizon, 89 articles remain and are analyzed in detail. The review identifies 832 cost forecast data points among these studies and categorizes the data points according to various parameters such as production region, production process and publication year of the study. Through a linear regression, a main trajectory for the development of hydrogen production costs can be derived. The costs of hydrogen from electrolysis are reduced on the basis of this trajectory, starting from the reference 5.3 € per kg, in 2020, to 4.4 € per kg, in 2030, and to 2.7 € per kg in 2050. The costs for natural gas-based hydrogen are almost constant on a globally aggregated basis. There are also major regional and process-related differences. In 2050, Asia has the lowest average costs of the regions analyzed at 1.8 € per kg and production by alkaline electrolysis with average costs of 2.0 € per kg appears to be the most cost-effective electrolysis technology. Although studies show a high degree of variation, it is evident from this review that the trend within certain investigation parameters is well defined. Therefore, researchers and practitioners can use this review to set up further analyses that depend on future hydrogen costs.","2024","2024-12-11 14:19:59","2024-12-11 14:19:59","2024-12-11 14:19:59","1806-1822","","9","8","","Sustainable Energy Fuels","Future costs of hydrogen","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The vast majority of the studies was conducted in medical or science education and was often called peer-assisted learning, while a minority used supplemental instruction or peer-assisted study sessions. The training for NPTs focused on didactic skills, subject-matter knowledge, or both and was mostly offered before or before and during teaching. The instruction that NPTs provided was problem/case-based, practical, metacognitive, or a combination thereof, and was mostly part of a course. Both students and NPTs consistently evaluated the provided instruction and their experience as positive. The training and the instruction consistently resulted in improved learning outcomes for students and confidence in teaching skills, communication, and leadership for NPTs. The results indicate that NPT is a valued and promising practice in higher education, but a common theoretical model that structures and explains how specific combinations of training, instruction, and outcomes are related is noticeably absent. The current body of literature includes many descriptive and exploratory studies with a myriad of unstandardized outcomes.

Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) curricula have been adapted in various countries to place increased emphasis on proficient data use and statistical comprehension. Consequently, there is a need for an adequate education and professional training of STEM teachers. This systematic review analyzes and synthesizes research on teachers’ statistical and data literacy in K-12 STEM education. A total of 42 articles were analyzed, with a specific focus on teacher variables, teacher education, and their impact on classroom practice. The findings emphasize the recent emergence of research in this domain, particularly focusing on statistical literacy, with mathematics being the dominant STEM domain explored. Most studies examined cognitive variables of both pre-service and in-service teachers, revealing relevant gaps in knowledge and skills related to statistical and data literacy. Limited attention was given to teachers’ affective variables. Research on the complex relationships between teacher variables, their teaching practices, and their students’ learning is scarce, necessitating further investigation. Several pedagogical approaches to prepare STEM teachers for promoting statistical and data literacy in their classrooms were identified. Positive impacts on teachers’ cognitive and affective variables were observed, but longitudinal effects and transfer to classroom practice require further inquiry. As curricula worldwide increasingly emphasize statistical and data literacy, this review underscores the necessity of enhancing teachers' competencies, advocates for tailored pedagogical approaches, and emphasizes the need for further research to shape effective instruction in K-12 STEM education.","2024-02","2024-12-11 14:25:57","2025-03-26 10:18:21","2024-12-11 14:25:57","31-45","","1","56","","ZDM Mathematics Education","Teaching for statistical and data literacy in K-12 STEM education","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","systematic_review; stefano_checked","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some pregnant women are more at risk of having unhealthy lifestyles, due to factors such as a low income or poor living conditions. Pregnant women affected by these vulnerability factors can be supported with eHealth lifestyle interventions that motivate them to make healthier choices. However, there remains a lack of insight into how these interventions are designed, used and implemented, and how they reach vulnerable pregnant women.                                   OBJECTIVE             This review aims to identify the strategies and considerations employed in the design, reach, use, and implementation phase of eHealth lifestyle interventions for vulnerable pregnant women, and assess whether these factors acted as facilitators or barriers. This review provides valuable insights for future developers of eHealth lifestyle interventions targeting this vulnerable population.We conducted a search on Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cinahl, Google, and Google Scholar, for studies that described an eHealth intervention for vulnerable pregnant women, focusing on at least one lifestyle component (diet, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, stress or sleep) and provided information on design, reach, use or implementation of the intervention.

These 29 papers described 20 eHealth lifestyle interventions. Apps were the most frequently used modality for the lifestyle intervention and most studies targeted multiple health behaviors with their intervention. Barriers identified in the design and use phase of these interventions included financial aspects and technological challenges for the target group. Furthermore, barriers were frequently encountered in the reach of vulnerable pregnant women, and included, among others, a lack of interest and time of the target group. Facilitators identified in the design and use phase included collaborating with the target group and other stakeholders (e.g. healthcare providers), leveraging existing eHealth platforms for modifications or extensions, and adhering to guidelines and behavior change frameworks. In addition, tailoring and the use of incentives were identified as potential facilitators. Regarding the interventions’ reach and implementation, collaborating with stakeholders and low labor intensity emerged as facilitators.

The use of active learning to prioritize potentially relevant records in the screening phase of systematic reviews has seen considerable progress and innovation. This rapid development, however, has highlighted the disparity between the development of these methodologies and their rigorous evaluation, stemming from constraints in simulation size, lack of infrastructure, and the use of too few datasets.In this study, two large-scale simulations evaluate active learning solutions for systematic review screening, involving over 29 thousand simulations and over 150 million data points. These simulations are designed to provide robust empirical evidence of performance. The first study evaluates 13 combinations of known well-performing classification models and feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF, SVM, Random Forest, and more across high-quality datasets sourced from the SYNERGY dataset. This baseline is then used to expand the scope of the evaluation further in the second study by incorporating a wider array of classification models and feature extractors such as FastText, pretrained transformer models, and XGBoost, for a total of 92 model combinations.The spectrum of performance varies considerably between datasets, models, and screening progression, from marginally better than random reading to near-flawless results. Still, every single model-feature extraction combination outperforms random screening.

SLRs are costly and require the scarce resource of highly skilled reviewers. Automation technology has been proposed to save workload and expedite the SLR workflow. Objectives  We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of SLR automation studies indexed in PubMed, focusing on the applicability of these technologies in real world practice. Methods  In November 2022, we ran a combined search syntax of four published SLRs on SLR automation. Full-text English peer-reviewed articles were included if they reported Studies on SLR Automation Methods (SSAM), or Automated SLRs (ASLR). Bibliographic analyses and knowledge-discovery studies were excluded. Record screening was performed by single reviewers, the selection of full text papers was performed in duplicate. We summarized the publication details, automated review stages, automation goals, applied tools, data sources, methods, results and Google Scholar citations of SLR automation studies. Results  From 5321 records screened by title and abstract, we included 123 full text articles, out of which 108 were SSAMs and 15 ASLRs. Automation was applied for search, record screening, full-text selection, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, evidence synthesis, assessment of evidence quality and reporting in 19 (15.4%), 89 (72.4%), 6 (4.9%), 13 (10.6%), 9 (7.3%), 2 (1.6%), 2 (1.6%), and 2 (1.6%) studies, respectively. Multiple SLR stages were automated by 11 (8.9%) studies. The performance of automated record screening varied largely across SLR topics. In published ASLRs we found examples of automated search, record screening, full-text selection and data extraction. In some ASLRs automation complemented fully manual reviews to increase sensitivity rather than to save workload. Reporting of automation details were often incomplete in ASLRs. Conclusions  Automation techniques are being developed for all SLRs stages, but with limited real-world adoption. Most SLR automation tools target single SLR stages, with modest time savings for the entire SLR process and varying sensitivity and specificity across studies.

Climate change has caused, directly or indirectly, health effects such as injury and physical injuries, which impact morbidity and mortality. Similarly, there is evidence that exposure to climatic catastrophes has serious repercussions on psychological well-being, and rising temperatures and drought have detrimental effects on mental health.               Despite the recent effort of researchers to develop specific instruments to assess the effects of climate change on mental health, the evidence on measures of its impact is still scarce, and the constructs are heterogeneous. The aim of this scoping review is to describe the instruments developed and validated to assess the impact of mental health related to climate change.

While these are widely considered as the classic policy approach, a substantial academic literature suggests the impact of financial incentives is not always positive; they can sometimes fail or even backfire. To test whether policy makers are overly bullish about financial incentives, we asked county heads, mayors, and municipal government representatives of medium-to-large towns in Germany to predict the effects of a financial incentive on COVID-19 vaccination, and tested the exact same incentive in a field experiment involving all 41,548 inhabitants (clustered in 10,032 addresses) of the German town of Ravensburg. Whereas policy makers overwhelmingly predict that the financial incentive will increase vaccination—by 15.3 percentage points on average—the same financial incentive yielded a precisely estimated null effect on vaccination. We discuss when financial incentives are most likely to fail, and conclude that it is critical to educate policy makers on the potential pitfalls of employing financial incentives to promote contributions to public goods.","2023-09-06","2024-12-11 14:29:49","2024-12-11 14:29:49","2024-12-11 14:29:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","","","","Open Science Framework","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the literature repeatedly points to inconsistencies in assessment methods and unclear measurement quality. We conducted a preregistered systematic review to compare and evaluate self-report assessments (including past cheating behavior and cheating intentions). In 256 instruments of 231 studies, 70% were unique self-report measures and 38.7% of studies did not investigate or report psychometric quality criteria. As such, the academic dishonesty literature is no exception in questionable measurement practices, where reports often lack key measurement information, such as the full item list (missing in 32%) or the time frames for behavioral assessment (missing in 50.4%). Our findings illustrate the threat to interpretability and comparability due to a lack of psychometric understanding and inconsistent measurement approaches. Contrary to aiming at a unified measure, we propose a focus on best practices in measurement construction and reporting to address diverse contexts, populations, and research questions. To guide future research, we provide a selection of psychometrically validated scales, analysis, operationalization, as well as reporting recommendations, and discuss methodological considerations to enhance the psychometric foundation of academic dishonesty research.","2023-08-11","2024-12-11 14:30:15","2024-12-11 14:30:15","2024-12-11 14:30:15","","","","","","","How to best measure academic dishonesty in students","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","","","","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These policies should be modeled in advance to see the implications for the environment and health. The aim of this study was to analyze these modeling methodologies.             Methods             We conducted a systematic review, searching Scopus and Pubmed for studies that modeled fiscal policies on the food groups targeted by the EAT-Lancet Commission and examined their health or environmental outcomes. We then double-screened the records, and extracted data on modeling methods from the 55 included studies. The review protocol was registered on PROSPERO (2022 CRD42022291945).             Results             The most frequently modeled interventions were fruit and vegetable subsidies and carbon taxes on food. One study also included a consumer education campaign to enhance the effect of fiscal policy. The outcomes are highly sensitive to consumption change and price elasticities. The stability of the amount of diet consumed was modeled 6 times with calorie stability, and twice with dietary weight stability. The outcomes were also sensitive to diseases and the system boundaries of environmental impacts. None of the studies modeled the health effects of environmental outcomes.             Conclusions             We did not find a model that covered all the relevant aspects of the issue. Some parts were missing from all the included models. It is advisable to model the stability of the amount of diet consumed, either by keeping the weight of the diet stable or by taking a more conservative approach and keeping the consumed calories stable. A fiscal policy is more equitable if a tax and a subsidy are combined to be less regressive. Additionally, an informational campaign as a complement could improve effectiveness. The included diseases and environmental boundaries are preferable to be broad to have more valid outcomes on this complex issue. A more comprehensive understanding of fiscal policies would allow us to better anticipate the impact of our actions and inactions and thus could lead to more sophisticated measures taken by policymakers.","2023-04-11","2024-12-11 14:33:40","2024-12-11 14:33:40","2024-12-11 14:33:40","","","","","","","Prospects of food taxes for planetary health","","","","","","","","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","In Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a clear overview of this research field is lacking, which makes it difficult to grasp which factors have been studied – either in isolation or jointly with other factors - to understand discrimination attributions, how robust the existing evidence is and where future research is needed. With this scoping review, we aim to systematically synthesize the existing evidence and identify the state of knowledge on the correlational and causal impact of different factors on discrimination attributions, building on and extending the reviews of Major and Sawyer (2009) and Barreto and Ellemers (2015). Additionally, this scoping review includes more modern forms of discrimination, such as microaggressions or workplace incivility as well (Marchiondo et al., 2018), allowing us to draw general conclusions about whether the same determinants and correlates have been studied in relation to modern forms of discrimination.","2023-03-24","2024-12-11 14:33:52","2024-12-11 14:33:52","2024-12-11 14:33:52","","","","","","","Protocol","","","","","INPLASY - International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols","","","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.37766/inplasy2023.3.0094","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The play situation is considered a save and controlled space in which children can learn to express their problems and to regulate their emotions, thus promoting emotional and behavioral adjustment. In early childhood, this process is thought to emerge in close interaction with caregivers. Parent-child play is thus viewed as an ideal window for parents to connect with their children and to support them in their social-emotional development. In this preregistered systematic review, we sought to integrate evidence from developmental and clinical psychology to shed more light on the role of parents in the relationship between parent-child play and children's behavioral adjustment as expressed in internalizing or externalizing behavior. Our review revealed that increased harsh control during play interactions as well as a lack of parental responsiveness, warmth and sensitivity were found to be associated with increased behavioral problems. Yet, no protective effect of warmth or responsiveness could be found in the context of risk groups. Moreover, the included studies indicated that positive affect expressed by parents during parent-child play was associated with fewer behavior problems in children, while negative affect was associated with more behavior problems. In general, this review revealed that quality and quantity of playful parent-child interactions were reduced in children with behavioral problems of both domains compared to children without behavioral problems. These findings illustrate the important role of parental characteristics during play interactions and their possible impact on children's behavioral adjustment.","2022-05-02","2024-12-11 14:34:40","2024-12-11 14:34:40","2024-12-11 14:34:40","822394","","","13","","Front.

Infection is one of the commonly reported outcomes in patients who are under disease-modifying treatments (DMTs). The Influence of patient characteristics on risk of infection was well documented in clinical trials. However, the understanding of patient characteristics and their impact on treatment outcomes in real-world settings, particularly in observational studies, remains limited. Objective To examine patient characteristics like demographics, geographical factors, and socioeconomic factors in observational studies investigating the relative risk of infection among individuals on DMTs for MS. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We included observational studies that examined the impact of DMTs use on the occurrence of infection in the MS population. A search was performed in PubMed and Embase and key patient characteristics were extracted from the included studies.  Results A total of 30 studies were included in the final analysis. The sample size ranged from 56 to 15,375 participants. The mean age of the study participants ranged from 24.5 to 54.4 years. The proportion of women ranged from 60% to 100%. The geographic representation of the included studies are Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Oceania. The disease duration ranged from 2 to 17.7 years. Ethnicity, Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS), Socio-Economic Status (SES), and treatment history were missing in many studies. Conclusion Within this sub-group, our findings indicate that people who are under DMTs for MS consists of younger adults and a higher proportion of women. The reporting of patient characteristics such as ethnicity, SES, EDSS score, and previous use of DMTs were inconsistently reported in the observational studies. This highlights the need for a standardised reporting structure to gain a better understanding of the specific patient characteristics that are associated with infectious risk.","2023","2025-02-26 15:55:55","2025-02-26 15:55:55","2025-02-26 15:55:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EN","CC-BY-NC-ND","Master Thesis","","","studenttheses.uu.nl","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
